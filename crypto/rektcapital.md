## Doge Coin Cycle Precursor to Alt Coin Rally

One of the most cyclical charts in the entire space. You see extreme fear, precede extreme greed. Doge coin runs tend to precede, or confirm entire alt coin seasons. Big green bar in the middle is the 2017 pump, the greatest alt season of all time, which cooincides with greatest doge rally of all time (until now). Currently, doge coin has pumped away beyond the areas it normally visits. Look at this current green bar compared to 2017.

Doge coin is intractley linked with alt coin season, and given the size of this latest green area, leads me to believe we are going to experience one of the greatest alt coin rallies of all time. Of course Elon musk did pump it. However, in December 2020 saw a new cycle on the horizon. Elon wasn't talking about it at this time, or before 2017 pump, or before that. Throughout history the technicals aline, we just need a catalyst to set off the cycle.

In every cycle the technicals are the same, align in same way. They align in the green area on the bottom. Doesn't matter what the reason for the catalyst is. What matters is the technicals align and suggest we are ready light the match.

People say doge coin is the entry alt coin. And that means many new investors are going to look for alt coin pumps elsewhere.

### Alt Coin Market Cap

Can see doge coin sparks off an alt season. 

On his chart (recorded feb 11th) can see on the cusp of breaking 2018 highs (ceiling red bar). Can see in the current chart we have surpassed that.

Reason I mention alt coin market cap, is doge coin cycles align perfectly with altcoin market cap increases.

HOW DO I DO THIS GRAPH IN TRADINGVIEW

Depending how large magnitude of doge coin rally, corresponds to how big the alt coin rally is. And we just saw the larget dog rally cycle in crypto history - should see corresponding alt coin market cap move.
