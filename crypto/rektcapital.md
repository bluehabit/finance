## Doge Coin Cycle Precursor to Alt Coin Rally

One of the most cyclical charts in the entire space. You see extreme fear, precede extreme greed. Doge coin runs tend to precede, or confirm entire alt coin seasons. Big green bar in the middle is the 2017 pump, the greatest alt season of all time, which cooincides with greatest doge rally of all time (until now). Currently, doge coin has pumped away beyond the areas it normally visits. Look at this current green bar compared to 2017.

Doge coin is intractley linked with alt coin season, and given the size of this latest green area, leads me to believe we are going to experience one of the greatest alt coin rallies of all time. Of course Elon musk did pump it. However, in December 2020 saw a new cycle on the horizon. Elon wasn't talking about it at this time, or before 2017 pump, or before that. Throughout history the technicals aline, we just need a catalyst to set off the cycle.

In every cycle the technicals are the same, align in same way. They align in the green area on the bottom. Doesn't matter what the reason for the catalyst is. What matters is the technicals align and suggest we are ready light the match.

People say doge coin is the entry alt coin. And that means many new investors are going to look for alt coin pumps elsewhere.

### Alt Coin Market Cap Follows Doge

Can see doge coin sparks off an alt season. 

On his chart (recorded feb 11th) can see on the cusp of breaking 2018 highs (ceiling red bar). Can see in the current chart we have surpassed that.

Reason I mention alt coin market cap, is doge coin cycles align perfectly with altcoin market cap increases.

He is using `log` view thats why his chart looks like this

HOW DO I DO THIS GRAPH IN TRADINGVIEW

Depending how large magnitude of doge coin rally, corresponds to how big the alt coin rally is. And we just saw the larget dog rally cycle in crypto history - should see corresponding alt coin market cap move. 

### Alt Coin market Cap Follows and Lags Ethereum on the USD pair

Ethereum broke out a long time ago from this U-Shaped reversal. Break out being the rectangle, perhaps turning it into support?

Lite coin is lagging behind on its reversal, so should be a great oppurtunity since its lagging behind ETH. Should see LTC hit ATH in the next few weeks or even months (again recorded feb 11th so this video is almost a month old now)

### Crytpo Money Flow Cycle

ETH is a very important component in this cycle. The `large caps` predominently `eth` but also `ltc`. It leads before the alt coins. But once eth rallies, you start to see some alt coins enjoy a rise as well. People start to profit circulate down into mid cap and low cap. So ETH is a market leader for alt coins because it precedes money flow into alt coins.

Where does doge coin fit in? If ETH is so important to alt coins kickstarting a money flow cascade down into alts, how does doge fit in? 

* #1. Doge coin tends to precede, or confirm alt coin season
* #2. Doge confirms increases in alt coin market cap
* #3. ETH is so important to kickstart moneyflow into large cap alt coins - doge coin is also important in kickstarting this money flow into alt coins as well. 

ETH carries market cap for alt coins.

If we look at doge / btc and eth / btc, can see these cycles line up. Doge coins confirm trends in eth in the btc pair as well.

But can see alt coins in their btc pairs, haven't yet triggered their rallies. And that is BECAUSE in the `ETH / BTC` pair has not yet fully confirmed its move to the upside. And the reason for that is it recently broke a key area of resistance
