* Treat fractal as a special kind of bar
* variance or symmetry that relates as a whole to its parts
* the whole can be divided into smaller parts and each one is similar to the whole
* fractal implies fragment of a whole, but if we see a small part, we can more clearly see the whole - they are very similar
* when we study fractals we do so with these characteristics: pattern of self similarity, at any scale of observation we can identify that this pattern exists, and the question is whether we can apply this fractal concept to finacial markets and the answer is yes look at the example below
* ![1](https://imgur.com/OIzi4IT.png)
* a pattern that is a type 2 pattern that we have validated
* in the illustration see the same pattern replicated in multiple charts the 1D, 240 (240/60 4 hours I think this is the 4 hour chart), 1 hour and 30 minutes, 15 min and 5 min - it is the same pattern replicated regardless of scale, the pattern is repeated. It doesn't mean the pattern is exact it is SIMILAR, similar - not exactness.
* fractals always hold in a way that is a phenomenon such as described by the founder of fractal theory by Benoit Mandelbrot, these fractals end following its course, as the river seeks its channel and this is fundamental and ends up being an accellertor that drives us toward trigger points, the fractal is telling us that.
* The speed at which we go from one point to another, or develop that path, but this is fundamental is they allow us to be prepared and know if these drivers end up accellerating that trajectory 

* double mountain pattern
* This target of 3076 was formed from the year 2009 when the second mountain ended, important is the minimum it does in 2009 (bottom red x on image). This is a very important line that marks the logrimathic scale trend from this point to this point.

* if the fractal was not fulfilled ...?
* IS IS IMPORTANT THAT THIS LINE BE DRAWN PRECISELY IN A LOG SCALE GRAPH, because when we mark trend lines on a log scale grave it allows us to have greater precision regarding those trend lines that end up serving as support or resistance
* look how much the graph changes if i disable log, no longer the same blue trend line

* having it in log allows for greater precision reading with trend line, another reason is this bullish channel that starts at the beginning of june

* Starts at the bottom of 2009 and has 10 years in this bullish channel
