* Treat fractal as a special kind of bar
* variance or symmetry that relates as a whole to its parts
* the whole can be divided into smaller parts and each one is similar to the whole
* fractal implies fragment of a whole, but if we see a small part, we can more clearly see the whole - they are very similar
* when we study fractals we do so with these characteristics: pattern of self similarity, at any scale of observation we can identify that this pattern exists, and the question is whether we can apply this fractal concept to finacial markets and the answer is yes look at the example below
* ![1](https://imgur.com/OIzi4IT.png)
* a pattern that is a type 2 pattern that we have validated
* in the illustration see the same pattern replicated in multiple charts the 1D, 240 (240/60 4 hours I think this is the 4 hour chart), 1 hour and 30 minutes, 15 min and 5 min - it is the same pattern replicated regardless of scale, the pattern is repeated. It doesn't mean the pattern is exact it is SIMILAR, similar - not exactness.
* fractals always hold in a way that is a phenomenon such as described by the founder of fractal theory by Benoit Mandelbrot, these fractals end following its course, as the river seeks its channel and this is fundamental and ends up being an accellertor that drives us toward trigger points, the fractal is telling us that.
* The speed at which we go from one point to another, or develop that path, but this is fundamental is they allow us to be prepared and know if these drivers end up accellerating that trajectory 

* double mountain pattern
* This target of 3076 was formed from the year 2009 when the second mountain ended, important is the minimum it does in 2009 (bottom red x on image). This is a very important line that marks the logrimathic scale trend from this point to this point.

* if the fractal was not fulfilled ...?
* IS IS IMPORTANT THAT THIS LINE BE DRAWN PRECISELY IN A LOG SCALE GRAPH, because when we mark trend lines on a log scale grave it allows us to have greater precision regarding those trend lines that end up serving as support or resistance
* look how much the graph changes if i disable log, no longer the same blue trend line 
* ![1](https://imgur.com/U2cqKHr.png)
* having it in log allows for greater precision reading with trend line, another reason is this bullish channel that starts at the beginning of june
* ![1](https://imgur.com/wl3lh2V.png)
* Starts at the bottom of 2009 and has 10 years in this bullish channel
* ![1](https://imgur.com/VLfvL0T.png)
* moves from seconds (I think?) scale ![1](https://imgur.com/r0LQiFp.png)
* to days ![1](https://imgur.com/HY0rQCb.png)
* This is a fractal pattern we have identified as a pattern of an expansive type 1, we have two types in a passive, type 2 expansive type and a type 1 expanisve type, this is a type 1 expansive type. We see here how we have this blue line that comes from beyond 2009 (the trendline that we established earlier), and this bullish channel we also established from 2009
* Here we count bounces in bullish channel / funnel 
* ![1](https://imgur.com/nTszGDU.png)
* What we have here is something very interesting 
* if we zoom, 26 bars/ candles, this one here does not go more than 10 this has not been seen the last time we saw this was in 1985 we managed to get 25 bars 
* ![1](https://imgur.com/HDJfKed.png)
* I think the blue line here is the EMA on the 1D, it says 
* ![1](https://imgur.com/XcAAhcu.png)

* Expansion type 1
* Notice how the rest of the graph is an estimate on the 2018 right hand side with a target of 3788.8
* we obviously understand market does not rise in a linear way because marekt is made up of impulsive and corrective waves
* TP  on the list are target prices, usually where profits are taken, or pt - price target
* this is part of a fractal that is running and that fractal, with classic charting many were not anticipating the break up here
* another myth with classic chartism has to do with triple top, but that did not happen, it continued upward
* we track the fractal and that allows us to have a map / compass of where things can go

* When we do fractal analysis we not only see that point, going from A to B, but the path we take from A to B with market corrections and pull backs
* ![1](https://imgur.com/GweHVXR.png)
* the macro repeats in the micro
* we are going to see his more frequently as we go down in temporality (go down in time, e.g. 1 day to 1 s)
* the market will tell us through another pattern if our current projection is going to break
* in fractal analysis we are simply listening to what the market is telling us 
* ![1](https://imgur.com/iXHbBEc.png)
* looked for volume to confirm break that comes from 2009 resistance levels? The resistance needs a whole movement or an expansion movement to break
