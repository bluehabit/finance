* Treat fractal as a special kind of bar
* variance or symmetry that relates as a whole to its parts
* the whole can be divided into smaller parts and each one is similar to the whole
* fractal implies fragment of a whole, but if we see a small part, we can more clearly see the whole - they are very similar
* when we study fractals we do so with these characteristics: pattern of self similarity, at any scale of observation we can identify that this pattern exists, and the question is whether we can apply this fractal concept to finacial markets and the answer is yes look at the example below
