When first started lost a lot of money doing the following

*revenge trading
*fomo
*chasin

Since then, bought myself condo, bought mom a condo, paid off student loans done very well for myself gotten better and better at it

mostly trade equities, do a small amount of options. Mostly trade positions, which means I dont scale in and out. Which means I find a TREND that I like, buy 50%, buy my other 50% and then sell 100%. Usually day trading or swing trading, focus more on technicals. Only get into stock if fundamental story makes sense. If im posting stocks in technicals thats because ive done the research already.

Need to be able to flip between bullish and bearish sentiment. 

Technical indicators, price, volume, trends, simple moving averages and fibs. And any underlying sector fundamentals.Relying more on the actual price action the actual candle formations to see what is happening. For timelines almost only looking at daily, hourly and 5 min. Mostly use the daily, sometimes will use weekly and monthly to see the setup, but for entries exits look at daily to know range for the day and then look at 5min or hour for entry or exit.
