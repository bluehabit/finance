in `volatile markets` probably best to `$ cost average` when its choppy, vs going `all in`. 

If you can say no to a trade, probably should - justin.

## SMA as support / resistance

its back over the `50` sma
look t osee if it will bounce off the `30` sma etc.

earnings week coming out BE CAREFUL with your stock how do you even check this. Would be cautious
with earnings

'stock is gaping up, too exciting for me' 
Don't want to try and chase pumps, wait for
backtest and confirmation, confirmation bounce on a STRONG resistance / support line vs a weak one
'im not going to buy a breakout'

penny stocks are volatile 
may want to add some to your list


â€‹Mat, how long after open does the market / volume tend to cool down?
-Usually 30 minutes or so after open so around 9am your time
-see pin update at 10am generally
- on 3/10 its volatile, its wedsnesy (rednesday), option expirey today i think best trade today is to not make a trade today


When you trade the open, do you try and wait for the market to cool off a bit at the 30 min mark. Or do you generally prefer to trade earlier when its more volatile?
-just wait for trade setups was his answer
-cant over analyze and rely on one strategy
-which is why have to be prepared for unexpected, use stop losses, profit targets all that stuff
pick a $ value for stop loss or a percent amount

'Rednesday'
usually red on weds? for SPY ? QQQ ?

hard to trade options when vix is moving 10-20% daily. vix directly affects option value, 
spy, apple, tesla liquid stocks easy to get a good fill even in the first 5 min of open, vs other stocks where might get a hard time getting fill

Being able to adapt, an investing environment (easy to go long) vs a traders environment 
where botoms are not in, and its choppy, hard to go long and make money, need to be flexible and adapt
strategies

most volume of the day happens at the open and the close

where should a stock bounce? its always at a previous top, trying to reclaim that level

6% down in 2 days is a big move on the S&P

## Intro Course

https://blazecapital.com/courses/

When I very first started, no experience bought gold based on yahoo finance artile stating that it was going to go up. Just looked at ticker on yahoo and bought in. 

When first started trading lost a lot of money doing the following. Ended up losing 42k. Ive lost all my money twice.

*revenge trading
*fomo
*chasin

Since then, bought myself condo, bought mom a condo, paid off student loans done very well for myself gotten better and better at it

mostly trade equities, do a small amount of options. Mostly trade positions, which means I dont scale in and out. Which means I find a TREND that I like, buy 50%, buy my other 50% and then sell 100%. Usually day trading or swing trading, focus more on technicals. Only get into stock if fundamental story makes sense. If im posting stocks in technicals thats because ive done the research already.

Need to be able to flip between bullish and bearish sentiment. 

Technical indicators, price, volume, trends, simple moving averages and fibs. And any underlying sector fundamentals.Relying more on the actual price action the actual candle formations to see what is happening. For timelines almost only looking at daily, hourly and 5 min. Mostly use the daily, sometimes will use weekly and monthly to see the setup, but for entries exits look at daily to know range for the day and then look at 5min or hour for entry or exit.

The goal is to give us a community a collective where eventually you guys surpass me and are giving me alerts and charts. Tried to do a free slack, and that didn't work. Want people who are serious and long term, not looking to do this for months, im talking years - decades. 

When I tell you not to do things, its from experience, I have already paid a price for those mistakes, like that 42k is expensive real world eductation. Every lesson im trying to teach you I had to experience it myself for the bad, sometimes its not enough to hear the person tell you what to do, sometimes you have to experience the pain yourself. So even though I might say its turning bearish its time to sell, you migth think nah this is good i know better etc. and experience it. This is what took us from losing money, breaking our accounts to going 4 or 5x and being very successful. Average s&p returns were about 9.8% in the last 10 years, rick has managed to do 50 years of s&p returns in 1 year (not usual returns). 

Important to know because lots of new users in chat will see an outlier stock run 20-30% run for like 4 days make it into news cycle and be like oh i better hop in now
but those are not normal returns, not normal, 5% is a big move for the day. When we see 10-20% thats very abnormal especially for multi billion $ companies. That can blow account up if people think any kind of stock trading 20-30% up and they think its block chain or energy boom again, it can blow up an account if you go margin on that. Need to manage risk and see whats going to happen in coming days weeks.

### Time of Day

Stock moves 2 times, volatility during the day, bell at the morning, and near the close, especially in last 15 - 30 min, what they call power hour 1 hour before close. **Time of day where stock not moving is the lunch break time eastern time.** Can have 3/4 of all movement in stock at opening and close. WHy opening? People rush in, or rush out at the end of the day. Usually open is busier than the close. Usually lots of price action overnight, could be news or some sort of change, any news during the day. But overnight, afterhours trading is very thin meaning not a lot of trading that happens over night. But the news cycle doesn't stop just because the bell rings. But also people who do not have time to trade during the day, have to leave for work and place order before leaving for work. Open is always the busiest. The first hour very active first 15-30min highest volatility / highest volume part of the day. At end of the day people are either profit taking, locking in losses, or repositioning themselves for the next day thats why closing can be high volume as well. Sometimes close more active than open, if some news in the cycle, but usually open thats busy.

Best time of day to trade, just before return of the trader after lunch break, through the 15min of the bell, 3-5 min bar *after* the bell thats not where you want to trade. If trying to get bigger % moves, I was more likely to go in on the first bar because i know if i catch it right i get a bigger move, and i had a smaller account so going after riskier trades. Problem with the open especially, have algos fighting each other, massive volume, knee jerk reactions which means go up initially and then drop down, go flat spike up, go down then spike up... etc very volatile hard to call and unless experienced much better off waiting for frist 15 min especially there is at least a trend established. Maybe ever first 30 min. That way can get a headwind on where the markets are going, can compare individual stock to sector (like tech) and the overall umbrealla (s&p). individual - > sector (tech) -> umbrella (s&p). Just like we say dont want to catch a following knife, dont want to pick absolute bottom, or absolute top. If try to catch absolute bottom, is you are attempting to catch it before a reversal potentially starts. Same at catching at top. 

EZ part of day. Hard time of day is open and close, have to be disciplined enough to buy or sell. In EZ part of day, higher probability of success and being correct, but lower % move. During hard part of the day higher probability of failure, but higher % move. At a bottom for example dont buy at the absolute bottom, wait for CONFIRMATION then go in, or you get out.

Part of EZ trade instead of buying lowest that you think you would go to and its highest, its buying a little higher than you thought, and selling even higher thats the best mentality. Wait until low of the day established, wait to confirm low is held, after low is held and its a higher low, its much more likely to have a higher low again so your risk tolerance  / risk reward is a lot better becuase now you know botom put in, trending up, and help higher low.

Mutual funds in my opinion (justin) is probably the worst investment because management fees are so high and if we look at a compound interest calculator, can see what 1-2% management fee does over time, lose like a quarter of your earnings. If you just average s&p returns at 9% take that to management account its half at 4.5%. Its half! Losing 2% of your profits means lose half your retirement thats a big deal (based on s&p returns). Lose a quarter on 1%! 

If you want to lock money up in things, put them in ETFs, do same thing as a mutal fund almost, better overall, manage yourself. Little fees. Ask broker what program is with ETFs. Some brokers can be free with brokers.

My property went up 25% in one year in vancouver, thats like 3x s&p return, thats one year and it compounds its stupid. From when this is recorded (anticpating major market correction in the next 6 to 12 months), I dont have anything long right now in stocks i like sleeping easy at night so mostly day trade, options etc.

`REIT are like real estate etfs`

Bonds are debt, getting fixed amount back, fixed income. Steady reliable income, thats why older goes higher in bonds until fully in bonds by retirement.

### Entries and Exits

When day trading same thing as trading long term, looking for entry and exit before we get in so we know ok buying stock at 10, anticipate going up to 12, and could go down as low as 9. So im risking $1 to make $2. Thats your risk reward ratio, how to calculate this? Instead of thinking a trade holding for hours, will hold for days, same risk tolerance. Like I say over and over should almost immediatley be right when you go into an investment because it means you have done the homework, checked fundamentals, technicals line up for a move. Now put money in and trend should be confirmed almost immediatly should not have to wait or average down. ANd when you do that entry more important than exit in my opinion. Because if you get in at a bad price your exit is going to be clouded by this. So say you bought canopy up at $46 US on day they announced, and then they open up at $35. You have to wait almost 2 weeks for it to go back up to $42. **Entry is super important because before you buy is when you are your most rationale.** What I do is with a journal, if I buy at 10, im selling at 12, my stop loss is at 9. So I already know that going in, because once trade is on can rationalize why should buy or sell. Instead of oh, its going to go up --- i think im going to double down and buy more in a losing trade. SHOULD GET CONFIRMATION RIGHT AWAY AND TREND HEADING YOUR WAY almost as soon as you enter. If my chart breaks, im going to get out as soon as it breaks. For example if im it at 10 and target was 12, but it starts breaking down, im getting out. As soon as i see something i dont like i get out, im not going to force a trade. Ill cut i if i something i dont like. If its at 10 and goes to 9.50, ill cut it i wont wait till 9 which was my actual stop loss because im not getting the confirmation i thought i was going to get.

Need to think like an investigator, impartial, what do I need to see to confirmt the hypothesis, what do I need to see to see if im wrong? Its applicable if your swing trading, long, day, its all candles some are 1min some are 10 some a day etc.

Buying stock means buying a partial ownership of that company. The way market cap gets calculated, people look at price and think oh aurora is cheap compared to canopy because its $8, no its not, just like iota and btc. Canopy is $58, but look at market cap. Way market cap is calculated is number of outstanding shares 

### Settlement

They make sure stock has been settled before they release the funds to you, so that means in a margin account, can still trade with full value but cannot withdraw funds that are not settled. Brokers are never going to lose money thats their business. Brokers make billions of transactions and they have checks and balances on each one to make sure no errors like accidentally adding an extra 0. Can still use money in account, but until its settled cannot withdraw. If your american rule I guess, cant trade stock more than 4 times, cant buy it more than 4-5 times in 1 week thats high frequency trading. Unless have day trader status with IRS not able to do this, cant do in and outs on same security over and over. Whereas me as a canadian can be in and out of a stock 10-20 50 times a day because we are scalping them, looking for small amounts of money on multiple transactions. Some people were thinking this had to do with settled, but thats not true, money is settled but FINRA preventing you from trading same stock over and over. If you only trade canopy, 5 times in 4 days, account can get suspended and that can happen in middle of trade. But can go into another stock. Same when a bank deposits a check they put hold on it to confirm money is in the account.

### Market Sentiment
market sentiment (peoples opinions, discussion on forums, media) can be very different from fundamentals. For example in this course talking about a dip in 2018 the fundamentals looked 'ok' but market sentiment was very bearish

Big media, CNBC, Wallstreet Journal, what is the message the talking heads are putting out?

#### VIX = FEAR INDEX
`PUT vs CALL / Ratio (VIX) = FEAR INDEX` this is what VIX measures! How much people are willing to pay for insurance now vs later. As people get more scared, get more fearful and willing to pay more for PUTS and downside protection (hedging?). 

Is **fear greed** index a good indicator of market sentiment? YES, is this the same measure of the above though, the vix basically? Not sure that is is because crypto has a fear/greed indicator but VIX is not part of that.

**FA** - Fundamental Analysis (underlying company, or ETF)
**TA** - technical analysis, charts basically. Another factor is **opening vs closing price** for me. Uptrends vs downtrends, what SMAs are we below 20,50,100 etc. Golden cross vs death cross, volume. **Creating new lows, or new highs?**
**Market Sentiment** - peoples opinion, discussions, forums, media. How many people are holding over night? IF people are not willing to hold over night they just dont know. Also what is your OWN feeling. Are you feeling less inclined to buy, or more stressed thinking about your holdings, are you thinking about it alot about it night, is it affecting your quality of life. We want to be sleeping good at night, dont want to be going to bed with our phone right beside us looking at every tick. If your not able to sleep good about this your probably nervous, and ify our nervous means you individually at least are bearish. Could mean your too big on a play. 
**Market overall** - e.g. Whole market vs the index, NYSE vs S&P. In 2018 S&P was outperforming the market index, the 500 companies that make up S&P probably showed the better earnings than the whole market. And also more sought after stock. Tech and financials highest weighted in the S&P. Can see `tech` and `financials` biggest categories for S&P500. So NYSE is overall market, S&P500 is the top 500 companies within NYSE, within S&P500 can be further subdevided by industry `QQQ` is tech (facebook, amazon, google) `XLF` is for financials. The bigger weighting bigger impact on the overall, tech is more than a quarter of S&P as you can see below, financials is 16%. NYSE Composite has every stock in every sector regardless of size in it vs if your just in tech or w/e thats how S&P500 can over perform the composite. ![1](https://imgur.com/WUY3BeO.png). S&P with only 500 companies can get a skew, or overperformance based on individual companies and sector performances. Also some of the individual stocks like Johnson & Johnson accounts for 2% of S&P500 holdings (confirm this) and it dropped 10% one day and that dragge the whole S&P500 down withi 

![1](https://imgur.com/u7STf2E.png)

But in reality is everything as bad as the media / traders make it out to be?

People normally do a buy back when they think there stock is cheap and dont have any other better way to spend thier money, because once you buy shares back money is gone. But if you can take 1 billion and invest it and can invest it into R&D for 10% return vs a buy back where you might get a 6% back from boosted stock price always makes more business sense to reinvest money becuase your going to get a better rate of return investing it. But sometimes buybacks are used to stop a stock from bleeding like facebook in 2018(?) I think it was. When announce a buy back because you think its cheap your basically announcing hey think its undervalued by x amount, should be 20% higher in our opinion. 

**Interest rates** also effect this, right now basically at 0% if you can borrow a billion $ for 1% and can get 5% in stock value, borrowing one and getting back 5. We did this for like 10 years with interest policies, and this boosted buy backs big time with 'free money' very little debt repayment to service on the interest. All the easy buybacks have been done and poeple are back to doing them for more historic reasons because they are undervalued.

**Clear policy on trade** with TRUMP its fucking up earning potential, its is important to have clear rules on free trade, when these are up in the air it effects companies ability to make investments. Need to know how trade effects GDP. Tradewar with china is not affecting much of GDP (media is saying), but actually eventually it would because at the time not all tarrifs were enforced.

![1](https://imgur.com/rON3KTk.png)

index fell off a cliff when the trdae war for initiated, each color on graph represents a different country

(all of this is from 2018 trade wars) Say your GM you get some imports from canada, for raw materials, you send raw materials to china where they get built out, they then ship them back to you and you work on them and they get added back to the car. Each exchange here, with tarriffs in place can incur additional cost penalities. And that makes it hard to forecast what your going to make in revenue because unclear policies because what you pay right now may be different 3 months out, 6 months out 1 year out etc.For example tarriff on aluminum is hurting them big time. What if GM need to build a plant that costs $1 billion and its not operational for a few years while being built, they are forecasting cost on price of build out, market size opportunity, taxes etc. forecasting 2-3 years out - so spending $1 billion today, but we are expecting this much of a return 2-3 years out but when those variables changed plant might not be viable anymore , that makes companies like GM pull out and tarriffs causing problems. These are lagging indicators, cant go back and unbuilt building once build, so companies cutting back on buildout with unclear policies. If building a plant takes 2-3 years, but we dont even have clear policy for next 2 years, why would you risk $1 billion on plant when have no idea what it will cost to maintain it? Most will hold back instead and consolidate, pay off debt, share buy back etc.**Trade imbalances** If US is buying more, and other countries are selling, overtime more tension. Bigger imbalance more country feels like taken advantage of. Monetary policy like US calling china currency manipulator, because what china can do is devalue currency. Alot of people know the canadian $ / usd discrempancy. E.G when both $s at parity, now canadians can buy more american goods for same $, more people traveling to US, more people buying online from US because roughly on par. Now our $ is at roughtly $1.33 which means each $1 would have spent in 2016 terms, now you are getting 1/3 less so less canadians buying us goods / traveling to US etc. Same thing with china, when they make their goods cheaper, meaning they devalue their currency, you buying chinese goods as an american it appears to be cheaper even though its artificial so all of this has a big effect on price as well.


### Monetary Policy

Can be huge lagging indicator, most of the time its 12 mo out thats 4 quarters, huge lag. Market can digest some changes like monetary policy, but if you add political uncertainty in as well (like trade war), market might not price in tightening as well as it should have and trade war then can do hyper active correction. 

One of biggest drops we have seen in the market on monetary policy is when JPOW said we are no longer going to remain neutral on intrest rate pricing and will increase rates, and markets tanked, and part of the reason in Justins opinion why this happened is because he did not define what going for like 3% or 2.5% just said 'above neutral.' so market had to try to guess and overcompensated to the downside.
Janet Yellen would give much slower changes to existing policy, not over night from going neutral to very tight liek JPOW, yellen was much more aware of lag of fed policy on market and data driven chairmen. JPOW was inpulsive did not deliver this news well. Also going back to bonds vs equities (stocks) can see year over date returns on equities are negative now, so if you can get a safe(? are they) 2-3% by buying bonds and don't have the headache no risk no worries why would you want to buy stocks? no risk in buying bonds.
Junk bonds, reason called junk bonds issues to companies that are not investment grade and that means have to pay higher return instead of 2-3% return have to pay 5-6% return. So if interst rates go up now the cost for these companies to pay back bond holders is higher so higher delinquinces and defaults. Can look at it with `JNK`. Bonds are RISK FREE, but lower return. With stocks, market decides. **Risk Parity**, expected rate of return these conditions might determine if your 50/50 bonds equities or 70/30 etc.

The Fed is the worlds bank, whatever fed does world reacts to it. As fed tightens, emerging markets will as well, can look at this with `EEM`. They have a much harder time servicing their debt bc have more debt, not as favorable returns, and generally debt is in USD. As stronger $ gets stronger suffer from that. If global economy goes down, their debt is in usd and their debt doesn't change cost of service goes up cant sell as much to pay the debt and becomes viscious circle whre they cannot get out of it.
Europe central bank, bank of china, bank of japan also important.

Oil is one of the key things that goes into inflation. And goes into feds key targets which is maintaining 2% inflation if oil dropped 30% in a month or two months (in the year 2018) not going to be reflected until numbers we see in 2019 so they have to try and predict how that will affect the market in a year from now for their current policy changes. We already know inflation is not going to be on target for the first half of 2019 becasue of this oil drop. If the fed says we know inflation is not going to be on target but going to raise anyway thats very hawkish, vs a fed that says wait we are going to see how oil reacts. All of this type of news might indicate its better to go into bonds - which can add more fuel to the downside of the stock market. This is an indepth analysis. 




#### Key Trends

Usually opening near the high, and closing near the low (again 2018 trade wars),on chart only have had 2 days since we have closed higher than open, every otherday open near high and closed near low, that means everything is being sold. Also death cross forming and breaking key trends, and also volume. If we zoom out to weekly chart.

### Sector and Stock conditions and sentiments

Generally speaking when the market is choppy, riskier assetts sell off more such as MJ stocks. For example, bitcoin, what happened to it? It fell off a cliff, then in october change in monetary policy fell off the cliff again. Super new sector, low utility its all speculation. The higher growth and higher risk are going to get these sort of sudden moves faster. 

Another thing thats important about these companies is the amount of debt that they are carrying, we went over that in the due-diligence section - but justin as a swing / day trader (at least when these videos were recorded in 2018, is that even something thats important to you, your just trying to ride the trend swing). Companies that carry more debt like Amazon as things change, have to price that in, if cost of servicing debt goes up, and economy is slowing, they are going to have a harder time repaying so that has to get priced in. That happens with any stock with high growth - Netflix is another example of this.

![1](https://imgur.com/Gwp3NNj.png)

![1](https://imgur.com/sSWsipw.png)

It has declined 80+% and its not the first time this has happened. Has done it consistently over and over.

#### Reading Sentiment

#### Headwinds

* Do we have headwinds for the overall market?
* Headwinds for the sector (tech, finance, pharmacy, MJ etc.)?
* Headwinds for some of the big names in that sector? 
* TA for individual stocks

Check, check, check? Bullish sentiment

#### Example 

This is canopy a MJ stock. All the easy trades are shown below. The highlighted section of the chart is more challenging, it cannot just ride the hype for easy gains anymore, now its more about fundamentals. The EZ money is not now, this is in a more mature sectore, has to trade on more fundamental stuff not the hype it did on last 3 years. Thats what we call a `cycle` and a `super cycle`, this started when Trudeau got elected and we rode that all the way until news coming in, got to `sell the news` and nothing else coming out. This is where people get burned in this purple section trying to `chase the pump` after years of running, 1000%'s of percent. Now in a corrective phase new ATH not going to be easy - **could take years before we see ATH again**.

![1](https://imgur.com/7ftUtnp.png)

**Just like example below most big cycles have a big ramp up, ATH, consolidation, leg down to digest and then move back up. Dont go straight up forever.**

![1](https://imgur.com/Zp1FTCn.png)

TRADING oppurtunity vs INVESTING oppurtunity. Like we mentioned in video this is a traders market not investment oppurtunities. Justin in the rough 2018 mj market was doing trading plays not investing. No catalysts left in the MJ candian market, before could ride the hype oh yeah legalized HYPE etc. Now all that is left is, hey did you hit your numbers? Thats all we have left in the canadian market. In the US market size is 10x bigger. Canadian market might be ok investment in the longterm 1-3 years plus, but can get better returns on my money trading right now. What would I look for to invest again? I would wait for higher high, then lower low, and then on first sign on move back up I would reenter, **would take my time for sure no rush**. If we slice the trendline (close below it or pierce it with wick) thats not a buy sign for me thats a wait. So until then sit on cash, or look at other sectors. MJ bill and farm bill came out in same week and still could not close out green for the week.

Let trade come to you, confirm moving higher, so we flush out all the weak hands that bought in the purple line - thats what a higher high means. Anyone who bought in this purple line has now had a chance to sell if a new short term high is reached (relative to the purple line)

![1](https://imgur.com/3jLkGln.png)

![1](https://imgur.com/UZEgiod.png)

#### Gap chateristics

Gaps not being filled - resist the top when its a gap down, or they resist the bottom when its a gap up. 

`Sell at resistance` that is something he does apparently. Sell resistance, rebuy after we hold a confirmation. On some of these MJ stocks, like bitcoin, not trading on fundamentals or eneterprise value at all its just market hype. So you have people in these stocks that are like well ive already lost 30% how much lower can it go pull up the chart check next level of resistance and alot lower actually - as much as 50% in this case.

https://blazecapital.com/course-3-entries-exits/ this course, section 5: sector stock and conditions and sentiment, that video about 24:30 min in he talks about these big hedge funds how they sell the news over and over same pattern everytime, pay attention to it. Dont buy news, wait for confirmation if you are wanting in. Need to see move up, and it hold.

![1](https://imgur.com/xYEtBOd.png)

#### Seasonality and Cycles

can look at these together. For example gas, winter its cold people need gas - supply is shorter, so more than likely a bullish move - can also call these sort of events `catalysts`. Now there is a corrective move going on after that where its pricing this in, and unless winter is longer and harsher or inventory is shorter than expected probably going to keep regressing toward the trendline. **The catalysts are now played out**. Reason sharing this is he posts his trades on the slack group and if you just look at charts might not know **WHY** he was antipating this winter move. `Understanindg why is just as important as knowing when to buy and sell`.

### Terminology

## Course 2 Due - Diligence

### Charting

Want to know 
1. how the overall market is doing 
2. how the sector is performing (tech, MJ, crypto etc.)
3. how individual stock is performing
4. any niagra falls stocks within that sectors e.g. crypto and BTC vs alt coins
5. I want to look at ETF for the sector before i look at an individual company for example in MJ stocks, HMJJ is just the majors it doesn't hold any small cap companies, GDX is major for gold minors GDXJ is the juniors for gold. In this example HMJJ the ETF for MJ marketspace was strong, the overall market was strong, now look at invidiaul company like canopy 
6. 


Here is one on SPY, clear bull chart but getting a bit over extended.
