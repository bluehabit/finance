When I very first started, no experience bought gold based on yahoo finance artile stating that it was going to go up. Just looked at ticker on yahoo and bought in. 

When first started trading lost a lot of money doing the following. Ended up losing 42k

*revenge trading
*fomo
*chasin

Since then, bought myself condo, bought mom a condo, paid off student loans done very well for myself gotten better and better at it

mostly trade equities, do a small amount of options. Mostly trade positions, which means I dont scale in and out. Which means I find a TREND that I like, buy 50%, buy my other 50% and then sell 100%. Usually day trading or swing trading, focus more on technicals. Only get into stock if fundamental story makes sense. If im posting stocks in technicals thats because ive done the research already.

Need to be able to flip between bullish and bearish sentiment. 

Technical indicators, price, volume, trends, simple moving averages and fibs. And any underlying sector fundamentals.Relying more on the actual price action the actual candle formations to see what is happening. For timelines almost only looking at daily, hourly and 5 min. Mostly use the daily, sometimes will use weekly and monthly to see the setup, but for entries exits look at daily to know range for the day and then look at 5min or hour for entry or exit.

The goal is to give us a community a collective where eventually you guys surpass me and are giving me alerts and charts. Tried to do a free slack, and that didn't work. Want people who are serious and long term, not looking to do this for months, im talking years - decades. 

When I tell you not to do things, its from experience, I have already paid a price for those mistakes, like that 42k is expensive real world eductation. Every lesson im trying to teach you I had to experience it myself for the bad, sometimes its not enough to hear the person tell you what to do, sometimes you have to experience the pain yourself. So even though I might say its turning bearish its time to sell, you migth think nah this is good i know better etc. and experience it. This is what took us from losing money, breaking our accounts to going 4 or 5x and being very successful. Average s&p returns were about 9.8% in the last 10 years, rick has managed to do 50 years of s&p returns in 1 year (not usual returns). 

Important to know because lots of new users in chat will see an outlier stock run 20-30% run for like 4 days make it into news cycle and be like oh i better hop in now
but those are not normal returns, not normal, 5% is a big move for the day. When we see 10-20% thats very abnormal especially for multi billion $ companies. That can blow account up if people think any kind of stock trading 20-30% up and they think its block chain or energy boom again, it can blow up an account if you go margin on that. Need to manage risk and see whats going to happen in coming days weeks.
