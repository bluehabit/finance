When I very first started, no experience bought gold based on yahoo finance artile stating that it was going to go up. Just looked at ticker on yahoo and bought in. 

When first started trading lost a lot of money doing the following. Ended up losing 42k

*revenge trading
*fomo
*chasin

Since then, bought myself condo, bought mom a condo, paid off student loans done very well for myself gotten better and better at it

mostly trade equities, do a small amount of options. Mostly trade positions, which means I dont scale in and out. Which means I find a TREND that I like, buy 50%, buy my other 50% and then sell 100%. Usually day trading or swing trading, focus more on technicals. Only get into stock if fundamental story makes sense. If im posting stocks in technicals thats because ive done the research already.

Need to be able to flip between bullish and bearish sentiment. 

Technical indicators, price, volume, trends, simple moving averages and fibs. And any underlying sector fundamentals.Relying more on the actual price action the actual candle formations to see what is happening. For timelines almost only looking at daily, hourly and 5 min. Mostly use the daily, sometimes will use weekly and monthly to see the setup, but for entries exits look at daily to know range for the day and then look at 5min or hour for entry or exit.

The goal is to give us a community a collective where eventually you guys surpass me and are giving me alerts and charts. Tried to do a free slack, and that didn't work. Want people who are serious and long term, not looking to do this for months, im talking years - decades. 

When I tell you not to do things, its from experience, I have already paid a price for those mistakes, like that 42k is expensive real world eductation. Every lesson im trying to teach you I had to experience it myself for the bad, sometimes its not enough to hear the person tell you what to do, sometimes you have to experience the pain yourself. So even though I might say its turning bearish its time to sell, you migth think nah this is good i know better etc. and experience it. This is what took us from losing money, breaking our accounts to going 4 or 5x and being very successful. Average s&p returns were about 9.8% in the last 10 years, rick has managed to do 50 years of s&p returns in 1 year (not usual returns). 

Important to know because lots of new users in chat will see an outlier stock run 20-30% run for like 4 days make it into news cycle and be like oh i better hop in now
but those are not normal returns, not normal, 5% is a big move for the day. When we see 10-20% thats very abnormal especially for multi billion $ companies. That can blow account up if people think any kind of stock trading 20-30% up and they think its block chain or energy boom again, it can blow up an account if you go margin on that. Need to manage risk and see whats going to happen in coming days weeks.

### Time of Day

Stock moves 2 times, volatility during the day, bell at the morning, and near the close, especially in last 15 - 30 min, what they call power hour 1 hour before close. **Time of day where stock not moving is the lunch break time eastern time.** Can have 3/4 of all movement in stock at opening and close. WHy opening? People rush in, or rush out at the end of the day. Usually open is busier than the close. Usually lots of price action overnight, could be news or some sort of change, any news during the day. But overnight, afterhours trading is very thin meaning not a lot of trading that happens over night. But the news cycle doesn't stop just because the bell rings. But also people who do not have time to trade during the day, have to leave for work and place order before leaving for work. Open is always the busiest. The first hour very active first 15-30min highest volatility / highest volume part of the day. At end of the day people are either profit taking, locking in losses, or repositioning themselves for the next day thats why closing can be high volume as well. Sometimes close more active than open, if some news in the cycle, but usually open thats busy.

Best time of day to trade, just before return of the trader after lunch break, through the 15min of the bell, 3-5 min bar *after* the bell thats not where you want to trade. If trying to get bigger % moves, I was more likely to go in on the first bar because i know if i catch it right i get a bigger move, and i had a smaller account so going after riskier trades. Problem with the open especially, have algos fighting each other, massive volume, knee jerk reactions which means go up initially and then drop down, go flat spike up, go down then spike up... etc very volatile hard to call and unless experienced much better off waiting for frist 15 min especially there is at least a trend established. Maybe ever first 30 min. That way can get a headwind on where the markets are going, can compare individual stock to sector (like tech) and the overall umbrealla (s&p). individual - > sector (tech) -> umbrella (s&p). Just like we say dont want to catch a following knife, dont want to pick absolute bottom, or absolute top. If try to catch absolute bottom, is you are attempting to catch it before a reversal potentially starts. Same at catching at top. 

EZ part of day. Hard time of day is open and close, have to be disciplined enough to buy or sell. In EZ part of day, higher probability of success and being correct, but lower % move. During hard part of the day higher probability of failure, but higher % move. At a bottom for example dont buy at the absolute bottom, wait for CONFIRMATION then go in, or you get out.

Part of EZ trade instead of buying lowest that you think you would go to and its highest, its buying a little higher than you thought, and selling even higher thats the best mentality. Wait until low of the day established, wait to confirm low is held, after low is held and its a higher low, its much more likely to have a higher low again so your risk tolerance  / risk reward is a lot better becuase now you know botom put in, trending up, and help higher low.
