*	Outside of channel, almost broke through the 50 dma at Friday closing at 380.36 for the week
*	The question is are we going to lose this for a 10% correction which would put us at a 354 target, or are we going to punch up and get a stimulus rally
*	Sorry for using a click bait title more so than usual, reason for that is I think people need a warning and by using that type of thumbnail going to get more clicks. Purpose is to not scare you but to inform of potential upside and downside.
*	Starting to get some confirmation from the bears, but its not quite there yet, need a daily close below $378/$379 to get below that 50 dma.
*	Also important to note we are starting to go sideways
*	People don’t understand what **bond yields** are and that’s whats driving the market right now – **bond yields**
*	If we zoom out and look at the **yearly chart**, we have almost a perfect **doji** showing a **roughly same size of wick on the bottom and top**, a doji generally indicates indecision. Reason for indecision is we see roughly same progress in bear territory as we do bull, although we see roughly 1.7% gain for the year. Not where the body for the candle is inbetween the wicks, the body is roughly in the middle. Which team is in control? Justin shrugs I dunno, they are both football teams bear and bulls roughly at the 50 yard line.

The body here being roughly in the middle equally, indicates bear and bull team are basically in a stand off so indecisive. Bulls are still in control but only barely at 1.7%. Also important to note on this firday (2/26/21) we closed out the monthly and weekly candles, why does that matter? Because these will be looking different on monday than they do right now. If we look on the monthly chart its technically bullish, why look at trend line trending up, **each month has huge wick on the top, micro wicks on the bottom** with **higher lows and higher highs*

If we break down from 373, if you check different time scopes, we lose the monthly
