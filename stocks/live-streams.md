*	Outside of channel, almost broke through the 50 dma at Friday closing at 380.36 for the week
*	The question is are we going to lose this for a 10% correction which would put us at a 354 target, or are we going to punch up and get a stimulus rally
*	Sorry for using a click bait title more so than usual, reason for that is I think people need a warning and by using that type of thumbnail going to get more clicks. Purpose is to not scare you but to inform of potential upside and downside.
*	Starting to get some confirmation from the bears, but its not quite there yet, need a daily close below $378/$379 to get below that 50 dma.
*	Also important to note we are starting to go sideways
*	People don’t understand what **bond yields** are and that’s whats driving the market right now – **bond yields**
*	If we zoom out and look at the **yearly chart**, we have almost a perfect **doji** showing a **roughly same size of wick on the bottom and top**, a doji generally indicates indecision.
