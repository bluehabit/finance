Stock MARKET CRASH 2021? - Bonds Rise | SP500 Technical Analysis 2/27/2021
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCOQb_3yf-Q&t=24s&ab_channel=BlazeCapital

*	Outside of channel, almost broke through the 50 dma at Friday closing at 380.36 for the week
*	The question is are we going to lose this for a 10% correction which would put us at a 354 target, or are we going to punch up and get a stimulus rally
*	Sorry for using a click bait title more so than usual, reason for that is I think people need a warning and by using that type of thumbnail going to get more clicks. Purpose is to not scare you but to inform of potential upside and downside.
*	Starting to get some confirmation from the bears, but its not quite there yet, need a daily close below $378/$379 to get below that 50 dma.
*	Also important to note we are starting to go sideways
*	People don’t understand what **bond yields** are and that’s whats driving the market right now – **bond yields**
*	If we zoom out and look at the **yearly chart**, we have almost a perfect **doji** showing a **roughly same size of wick on the bottom and top**, a doji generally indicates indecision. Reason for indecision is we see roughly same progress in bear territory as we do bull, although we see roughly 1.7% gain for the year. Not where the body for the candle is inbetween the wicks, the body is roughly in the middle. Which team is in control? Justin shrugs I dunno, they are both football teams bear and bulls roughly at the 50 yard line.

Doji

The body here being roughly in the middle equally, indicates bear and bull team are basically in a stand off so indecisive. Bulls are still in control but only barely at 1.7%. Also important to note on this firday (2/26/21) we closed out the monthly and weekly candles, why does that matter? Because these will be looking different on monday than they do right now. If we look on the monthly chart its technically bullish, why look at trend line trending up, **each month has huge wick on the top, micro wicks on the bottom** with **higher lows and higher highs*

Still moving up

If we break down from 373 red year to date, if you check different time scopes, we lose the daily uptrend, monthly uptrend and 363 becomes next support uh oh. **We are at a 2.5% cut thats not enough for damage, I guess maybe thats why 1% is the stop loss because with traditional stocks 1% is a decent size move**. In 10 minutes half the progress we made in 2 months (yearly gains through feb) is a pretty big cut.

### Next look at option chain to see if clues to see where we are going to go

Bears on options won this friday (2/26/21). Pulling up chains for next week

Think this time might drop 10%  - 20%. Trying to walk cuts lower.

This is for monday march 1st. Lots of activity here at `380`. Look at premium attached to them, `3`, that is `380-3=377` its IMPLYING $377 going into monday which would be BELOW The 50 DMA on monday. Thats a big Clue.

They are also buying all the way to `383`, `383` has `4.50` in premium which implies `378.5` why does that matter, thats where our 50 dma is.

People are betting monday we are going to break the chart and crack the 50 dma. Bullish or bearish have to give these people respect because they are putting up more $ on puts than the calls. `Volume of 34,152 x 1.5` is more than $50 million that traded? Even though that number comes out to 51,228 so not sure maybe because it reprsents 1k? Chain is implying down.

**What site is he using for option chains**?

### I dunno

Treasuries `TLT` alerting on the daily chart.

`SH1` alert = SH (proshares short ONE DAY) alert
algo alert monday (2/22), friday (2/26)
feb 21st
sept 3rd

These `SH1` alerts correspond to these drops on the `S&P500`. Pink arrows on below image show where the alerts went off on SH and when S&P500 dropped. So this is more evidence, in addition to the option chain, so now more bearish than thought before. Got these algo alerts as he was doing videos. Telling us S&P bearish for the next few weeks to months
