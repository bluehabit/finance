Stock MARKET CRASH 2021? - Bonds Rise | SP500 Technical Analysis 2/27/2021
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCOQb_3yf-Q&t=24s&ab_channel=BlazeCapital

*	Outside of channel, almost broke through the 50 dma at Friday closing at 380.36 for the week
*	The question is are we going to lose this for a 10% correction which would put us at a 354 target, or are we going to punch up and get a stimulus rally
*	Sorry for using a click bait title more so than usual, reason for that is I think people need a warning and by using that type of thumbnail going to get more clicks. Purpose is to not scare you but to inform of potential upside and downside.
*	Starting to get some confirmation from the bears, but its not quite there yet, need a daily close below $378/$379 to get below that 50 dma.
*	Also important to note we are starting to go sideways
*	People don’t understand what **bond yields** are and that’s whats driving the market right now – **bond yields**
*	If we zoom out and look at the **yearly chart**, we have almost a perfect **doji** showing a **roughly same size of wick on the bottom and top**, a doji generally indicates indecision. Reason for indecision is we see roughly same progress in bear territory as we do bull, although we see roughly 1.7% gain for the year. Not where the body for the candle is inbetween the wicks, the body is roughly in the middle. Which team is in control? Justin shrugs I dunno, they are both football teams bear and bulls roughly at the 50 yard line.

Doji

![1](https://imgur.com/fd1GMFY.png)

The body here being roughly in the middle equally, indicates bear and bull team are basically in a stand off so indecisive. Bulls are still in control but only barely at 1.7%. Also important to note on this firday (2/26/21) we closed out the monthly and weekly candles, why does that matter? Because these will be looking different on monday than they do right now. If we look on the monthly chart its technically bullish, why look at trend line trending up, **each month has huge wick on the top, micro wicks on the bottom** with **higher lows and higher highs*

Still moving up

![1](https://imgur.com/hF247jh.png) 

If we break down from 373 red year to date, if you check different time scopes, we lose the daily uptrend, monthly uptrend and 363 becomes next support uh oh. **We are at a 2.5% cut thats not enough for damage, I guess maybe thats why 1% is the stop loss because with traditional stocks 1% is a decent size move**. In 10 minutes half the progress we made in 2 months (yearly gains through feb) is a pretty big cut.

### Next look at option chain to see if clues to see where we are going to go

Bears on options won this friday (2/26/21). Pulling up chains for next week

Think this time might drop 10%  - 20%. Trying to walk cuts lower. 

![1](https://imgur.com/F4XMvQb.png)

This is for monday march 1st. Lots of activity here at `380`. Look at premium attached to them, `3`, that is `380-3=377` its IMPLYING $377 going into monday which would be BELOW The 50 DMA on monday. Thats a big Clue.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10590095/109401213-f616e580-7912-11eb-8330-51c203ae9532.png)

They are also buying all the way to `383`, `383` has `4.50` in premium which implies `378.5` why does that matter, thats where our 50 dma is. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10590095/109401407-24e18b80-7914-11eb-95b6-ba18c16a08ee.png)

People are betting monday we are going to break the chart and crack the 50 dma. Bullish or bearish have to give these people respect because they are putting up more $ on puts than the calls. `Volume of 34,152 x 1.5` is more than $50 million that traded? Even though that number comes out to 51,228 so not sure maybe because it reprsents 1k? Chain is implying down.

**What site is he using for option chains**?

### I dunno

Treasuries `TLT` alerting on the daily chart.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10590095/109401630-5f97f380-7915-11eb-9c7a-60e09defdbc5.png)

`SH1` alert = SH (proshares short ONE DAY) alert
algo alert monday (2/22), friday (2/26)
feb 21st
sept 3rd

These `SH1` alerts correspond to these drops on the `S&P500`. Pink arrows on below image show where the alerts went off on SH and when S&P500 dropped. So this is more evidence, in addition to the option chain, so now more bearish than thought before. Got these algo alerts as he was doing videos. Telling us S&P bearish for the next few weeks to months

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10590095/109401684-aa197000-7915-11eb-8c3f-261a7771b5e3.png)

![1](https://imgur.com/4O7XgYn.png)

again 10% move correction 20% Bear market

`vix` also giving us algo alerts. So we have warnings from Justin the human, and algo, uh oh, hang on to your butts. Last time we had these warnings were in Feb 2020 and Sep 2021 which led to 30% drop and 10% drop. Seing option flow confirmation, Technical confirmation, Algo confirmation I think recipe is to go down now. If we are losing 10% is there anywhere for a risk reward ratio, meaning if we risk $1 we can at least make a $1 in profit. R of 1. Is it probable, not just possible.

Sideways also doens't mean down, it just means flat.

If you look at the `w` shapes, if you take the bottom and top of the `w` it kind of forms a channel, and if you notice on this latest `w` it is very small, narrow channel, and we are now trading `sideways` basically so the chart is bascially `flat`.

![1](https://imgur.com/IoGmkeQ.png)

A daily close below `385` is a warning, a weekly close below `378` is confirmation

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10590095/109402087-8a377b80-7918-11eb-888f-5b648bcfd3fb.png)

Last time what caused S&P to drop was tech stocks, this time its treasuries. Treasury yield increase, stocks go down. We get bullish news from stimulus, not getting bullish reaction. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10590095/109402131-f6b27a80-7918-11eb-8e99-6e77403c1a98.png)

If we look at treasury yield vs SPY S&500 etf dividend yield at 1.5% right now 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10590095/109402153-15187600-7919-11eb-8487-9ec762a5c573.png)

What is a treasury bond / treasuries , treasury gov debt. to finance gov spending as an alternative to taxation. Fed reserve purchases treasuries to fund the goverment instead of taxing. They are artificially buying debt, that no one else wants to, meaning that they are artificially supporting the economy. Why does that matter, backed by the US gov, only way they would not be able to pay this back is if the US gov fails.

10 year treasury 
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10590095/109402201-780a0d00-7919-11eb-9d8e-812d94cbfa8b.png)

OVer the next 10 years assumming inflation is not going to be above 1.4 averaged out otherwise losing buying power. However in S&P if you are getting a 1.5% dividend yield every 4 months but the market is dropping by more than 1.5% you are getting no net benefit. If your dividend is at 1.5% but market drops by 1.35% you are only yielding .1 percent. Tresasury is RISK FREE RETURN. WHat can you get without any work and no thinking, might lose buying power, but not going to lose anything on the underlying asset. `If treasury bonds keep going up stocks are going to be under more pressure.`

WHY is this going up? 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10590095/109402242-df27c180-7919-11eb-9011-f519cf5be32d.png)

Algo is saying (pink bar on above chart) keep going higher for weeks to months. Pink bar is an investment bar for the algo, investment meaning weeks to months. 

The financial crisis in 2009 a quarter a issue of what we have now, doing 4x more printing now than then. A 10 year treasury means you are lending the US gov money for the next 10 years, going to give you a yield 1.4% return. The outlook for the next 10 years, if we are printing 4x than we did during 2009 crisis, the problem is a quarter as bad, thats a factor or 16x, printing 16x more relative than problem we have. More printing = more money going into system = more inflation = bonds have to rise becuase inflation is going to be higher.

As people are sitting at home during this pandemic not spending money inflation is neutral because not spending money. However as we get stimulus checks, go back to work, economy rebounds, go back to work, that causes growth that causes inflation why more money in system. As we looked at before `oil prices going up, food prices going up` those are `two major factors` in `CPI consumer price index`.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10590095/109402385-22cefb00-791b-11eb-9e38-222b692b1dc8.png)

Eventual tapering tantrum means QE the fed res purchases treasury yields to artificially move them lower, why lets pretend there selling 100 treasuries , normal apetite for investors is they are going to buy 50 of them, but when fed buys 100 the yield goes down because more buyers so command lower price. So the fed stops buying there is all this supply / demand not filing anymroe someone else is going to have to fill it. 

So if they want to keep selling prices are going to have to go up thats what taper tantrum is. Not just that but `raising intrest rates`, if inflation gets to 2% and employment is full fed says we will begin raising rates. If gov is going to be rasiing rates, bond yields have to rise  too.  ![1](https://imgur.com/OzEb2ow.png)

Taper tantrum - on investopedia
https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taper-tantrum.asp#:~:text=Taper%20tantrum%20refers%20to%20the,quantitative%20easing%20(QE)%20program.

QE is fed punch bowl, liquidity. Same kind of commentary from `black rock`. He is saying don't buy bonds, dont buy that they are downgrading it.

Fed heads talking. Fed hawkish means bearish for stocks, dovish fed means bullish for stocks. Feds usually have panel of hawkish / dovish people, and can see how the markets react for the dovish/hawkish policy. Feds talking really really matters, cannot emphasize this enough. They need to use this dip down to the 50 dma as either a bull pivot or a bear pivot. The fed head panel sets the tone, and JPOW delivers the punch on thursday. The panel t's it up for JPOW, he is the big player if he came in as first speaker on monday and says the wrong thing can mess everything up. News vs reaction to the news. Panel gives them a preview of how the market is going to respond. This group is the FOMC Federal Open Market Committee

Thats why alot of potential as we go into friday of next week.

### Seasonality Chart

What normally happens this time of the year, seasonly? OMG we drop jan through march, rally in april

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10590095/109402598-aa693980-791c-11eb-93ff-5f41396985b9.png)

### Global Indicies

Is US only one struggling how about rest of the world?

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10590095/109402638-fcaa5a80-791c-11eb-82d0-f2562e7a32b7.png)

#### Payroll friday

adding jobs?

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10590095/109402722-be616b00-791d-11eb-906b-0ba74946d270.png)

If this number is weak could be spun as positive or negative.

Keep that in mind on this comment

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10590095/109402730-d46f2b80-791d-11eb-8f30-3daadb54d1eb.png)

If jobs come in red, oh well we lost more jobs than we thought got to print more. If it comes in decent, hey positive sign but not at max employment yet so not time to raise rates.

Trying not to just tell you what happens, trying to give you the clues im using to build a case.

If your bull prepare for worst, prepare for bear. Even though you expect bear. And same conversley, make a plan, then work the plan.

### Stock Rotation, MUSICAL chairs

Generally speaking if see stocks going down, want to see something else going up like gold to see people ROTATING around, treasuries went up 3% people are like screw gold, screw bitcoin i want them TBILLS / treasuries. Theres a theme. do you understand?




## LIVE STOCK MARKET Q&A - Top 3 Investing, Trading Rules and Best Practices [May 20, 2020]

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9GKF3oN-sY&list=PL6o37jvhqx9b8j1AR8GOehWI0vLstXEdW&ab_channel=BlazeCapital

While learning, without experience etc. trades and positions should reflect that.

For average trader, losing 5% and cutting loses is acceptable. Once you get to 10% gets harder to admit you were wrong on the trade and hurts. From 10, 15, is even less because you get beat up and start to accept the loss, and beyond. When people stuck in trade dont know what to do, dont want to mentally accept it.
Its ok to make a mistake, you dont have to lose a ton of money. I know this, because I do it too (justin). The worst part is you might shutdown, and not LEARN.

Always talk about risk / reward. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10590095/109405884-42295080-793a-11eb-9046-b6d5ee5da660.png)

If you start trading and expect to make a money on first couple days / trades, not a good mentality. The market humbles all it just takes enough time. Expect the best, prepare for the worst, and be prepared for a suprise. S&P return is about 9.8% per year, how much should we be able to out perform the S&P per week? Lets call it 20%. Lets pretend starting with 10k investment, not adding money, just growing it. Semi pro thats why im only using 2x. That means you need about .5% a week thats .07 per day, a tenth of one percent almost. Takes about 12.5 years to get 10k to 100k even with compounding.

Should build up on a small base to learn. If we are learning dont want to blow our account only put in 5k or 10k, not 25.

Warren Buffets ROI is 30% per year.

Lets see how we can compress this time line. Just does 'both' he has a business and a personal to maximize tax benefits, what does both mean here?

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10590095/109406429-9b937e80-793e-11eb-917a-31d9e7ad2235.png)

Logging is critical, remember what gets measured gets improved. Logging trades, probably took me 5 years to learn.

Market Wizards book interview with top traders, try to learn from their mistakes so I dont make them myself. Before you can compound your account, have to be able to earn a consistent profit. Before can earn profit, need to learn what you dont know. Therefore, if you are in the learning stage, avoid trading like you are trying to 'grow your account' e.g. not going all in, trading in smaller amounts etc. If you are learn stage, are you trading like you are still trying to learn or are you punching above your weight class. If learning, dont get discouraged.

Annaul Letters from Warren Buffett also a good book

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10590095/109406597-f679a580-793f-11eb-8cf9-5806185a8c92.png)

Trying to 'make trades back' is revenge trading. Say you bought in at $100, and its at $90 people want to get out at break even, instead of taking a hair cut thats the human tendency. Would you buy the trade fresh here? **If you are in a losing trade, question is would you buy it fresh here. If going long would you buy it right here? If answer is no, the trade is now bad and how bad it gets is up to you. If the answer is no, GTFO.** Read these carefully, would you buy this stock right now in cash and go long, if answer is no you got losers in your port. Cutting your winners fast and letting your losers run is a common problem for new traders. If you can be decent after 5 years you are beating me , took me 5 years to stop stucking. Remember what justin said also on another video, you should do your research before enterting a trade - and see confirmation shortly after buying into it of your hypothesis.

When justin started being successful about 5 years ago he was swing trading at the time, living on the west coast he could wake up at 6:30 am, from 6:30 to 8am basically had 2 hours to trade the open which was perfect. Would trade open, go to job, swing trade, set alerts. **Justin says something to the effect of let trades come to you in this video I believe**.

### WHATS THE COST TO EXIT AND THEN RE-ENTER

Most broker commissions are zero now a days, close the trade and get back in if you see confirmation. If you still like it can buy it back 2 seconds later if you want. It resets your profit and loss. **Just SELL, get back in!**, wanting to 'break even' is a natural barrier for humans I didn't even know about this until 5 years of trading - yah well of course I want to get my money back why would i get out for less (lol). After i got KO'd 18 times I finally understood.

### Trading Slump

When in a trading Slump, natural tendency to want to make it back, usually thats a trap. people generally want to break even thats human psychology. Aim is to be PROFITABLE not perfect, its ok to have losing trades, or a string of bad trades. Tjhese best practices are condensed basically from the market wizards book. If in a slump take a step back - take a break try to avoid trying to make it back and erase losses.



#### Q&A

How do you pick your support / resistance levels? I usually get my levels from daily level. Justin often puts in a red line (resistance) and a green line (support) and then a blue line for the trend line. Starting off zoomed out on the daily

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10590095/109407126-fda2b280-7943-11eb-927e-84d6c011969e.png)

zooms in on the 5 min for more detail

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10590095/109407138-0f845580-7944-11eb-828a-e2e2f963890b.png)

Here on the 5 min trying to figure out how we get from 775 to 800, how is that going to happen? The levels are set from the daily, but then I zoom in with those levels still on (as shown in this 5 min diagram) and trying to figure out is there a trade here. So for example on this one, I would wait for it to break and hold 775, back test it for confirmation ? and then ride it up. 


### BTC has an option chain ....

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10590095/109407739-f7fb9b80-7948-11eb-817d-3edc1fbb98ae.png)

Need to learn to read this shit

##### Trend lines on the bodies

**I prefer to use real body for support / resistance and not the wicks**, the reason why is when we zoom in, the real body basically means what the real opening and closing price was. And why does that matter? Well where is most of the volume.... at the open and close. Its not that i dont care about where the wick is, I care more about where the real body is because thats where volume is, and where most volume is mean more shareholders tested - so a key level. This ZM one if it breaks ceiling becomes **blue sky breakout**.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10590095/109407195-69851b00-7944-11eb-80c9-370199daf5d3.png)

For this trade right here I personally wouldn't do it, how much can we make, lets measure

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10590095/109407255-eb754400-7944-11eb-8fd1-145292243d8e.png)

Can make about 1.5%

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10590095/109407261-fcbe5080-7944-11eb-8942-b17dce7ff03f.png)

However ... trade is not going to be quite as easy, **its much closer to resistance than support**, so what that tells me is that at the end of this funnel downside risk - going from where we are currently to next support level (green), which is 21%...

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10590095/109407289-3beca180-7945-11eb-8a89-8d9a3fe80cf1.png)

If im going to risk 21% potentially 1.6% yah... pass

Volume is one of the #1 things I look at
And support resistance
Are we trending up or down?
On BYND if we were to get above `148`, one of the key levels in red (resistance) then our target is `161`. If we were to lose `148`, then our support target becomes `116`.

`increasing price, decreasing volume` that is a warning!

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10590095/109407367-d816a880-7945-11eb-8992-5d9f810c9c2d.png)

Tech Stocks Rally! Cathie Wood STRIKES BACK! ARKK, TSLA, AAPL | Stock Market Today
3/9/2021

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7B0BOBey0HE&ab_channel=BlazeCapital


could move higher tomorrow (weds)
let people buy temp short term highs into thurs
and down into friday

algo alerting on
s and p 500 20% of all stocks
nasdaq 25% of all stocks

alot of alerts on the algo however, lots of 
bearish on the options chain, not seeing bullish CONFIRMATION on the options flow, lots of bear best on SPY, lots of bear bets for 3/9/2021. And these are pretty big bets. So story is maybe tech ready to rally, but why not let people buy the short term top and short it down into friday. For them to get to get paid friday it needs to drop quite a bit, by 3 points or so it looks like, on this option chain for SPY see several 2.5-3 million put options, thats alot.
Looking at QQQ see similar bearish sentiment on option chain - see a $4 million put option here thats a big bet. Also note how much they paid in premium, they paid about $2, thats alot in premium. 

people want to buy apple want to buy tesla? let them buy the short term top on thurs

my safest play recommendation wait for friday,
if we get dip on friday do overnight weekend hold
if bill passes likely to  be a buy the news on monday

What I think is happening with tech stocks right now (Tesla, Apple) is after this big push today (tuesday 3/9) is letting people chase it tomorrow 3/10 weds. OMG gap up i def got to buy that gap up
, so then they gap it up and dump it. Could be wrong. Friday good oppurtunity to get in, if they dump it down between 3 and 3:15 is when we want to get really bullish for following week here.

The S&P needs QQQ or XLP (consumer staples like coke) to rally here to push the S&P overall. QQQ is the tech stochs like (apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Tesla, nvidia)

overall think we are going to go up tomorrow, but probably decline into friday, with eod rally possible which would be bullish to buy and hold over weekend.

## RBLX Stock, ROBLOX - LIVE ANALYSIS 📈🔥 [GME, TSLA, TECH STOCKS]
3/10/2021

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDZqMnT1tFw&ab_channel=BlazeCapital

Whats the joke for IPO? `Its probably overpriced`

The people in chat were there live for the first day of the Roblox IPO, lots of people saying to the moon, to $1,000 etc.. Looking at other IPO stocks like Bumble inc, wait for `1d` alert. You guys are not going to like hearing this but always pull up the `investor psychology chart` its a constant cycle of feareful and greed over and over and over and over AND OVER AND OVER. People in chat were like I NEED TO BUY MORE, I need to tell my friends! We are all going to be rich. You guys are soundign euphoric. 
I was there when it was live, when it was pumping to 75 chat was euphoric when it started stalling chat wasn't sounding so high and mighty
Thats why people like me `WAIT`. We `WAIT` for a `catalyst`, the `catalyst` is the algo. `Waiting and Waiting, wait on idea, validate idea, execute.` Choppy day Justin waid waiting and waiting today, wait on the idea, validate, execute, dont force it. Wait. 

In general IPO's on day 1 do not hold gains. If it RIPS upward on IPO day probably going to dip hard the following next several days. If it DIPS on the initial IPO offering it tends to RIP at a later date (days, weeks, months later). Thats the template all IPOs that have done good usually

While he was live on `Roblox` volume started to stall and the stock started trading sideways.

5 Big lows is a pattern that can sometimes lead to big reversals. Because by that time you are at the `bottom` of the `psychology chart` where `depression and anger` set in.

Have a plan sell as you approach profit targets and or major resistance areas. If you still like it, can buy it back after it backtests over and confirms on resistance. 

The FA (fundamental analysis) on Roblox put the IPO estimate worth about 30 billion which is equivalent to about $45 a share. On the IPO it rode $75 which would make it worth 40 billion. It added 2.5 `amc`'s worth of market cap, thats insane, no way its worth that much. Even if a stock continues pumping hard, the longer it pumps without retesting the more exhausted its going to be. Its healthy to drop, correct, back test and then continue working upward. The more the uptrend without backtest, the riskier it becomes.

Instead on IPOs wait for a 20%, 40% drop w/e on price, wait for it to start to curl back up with bullwicks with your alert / algo confirmation and then go in and buy. 

Roblox paying devs more than they earn. For every $1 they earn pay out almost 2.5x to devs that SUCKS could be okf if they are a `growth` company but they are not. How are they going to make `$`? If management cashing out why are you buying right now? you are making management money not yourself most likely. Need to separate yourself from company compared to its chart. Check yourself i you are saying things like 'this is a great company, it will rebound, shares on discount!, didn't you hear its a great company it will come back. Why does management team IPO and choose to go public? Because they need the money, management team wants to cash out and get paid, they are selling to retail like you. Justin does not like investing in companies that sell to kids like roblox.

Somone in chat from a different stock bought in at `$40` and the stock had risen sharply to `$60`, but she didn't sell there and it dropped ot `$45` chart was starting to look fugly but she did not want to sell for a small profit. There was not much support below the $40 area and the backtest failed. Instead she let a green trade turn red. Justin some of my worst trades ever were initially green, but didn't take profit and let them run red. I SUCKED for 5 years buying the tops and selling the bottoms, over and over and over. I dont want you to suck or make the same mistakes that I did. Justin has made eveyr mistake at least twice.

`dark pool prints what dis`

he ran FA (fundamental analysis) prior to 3/11 when earnings are reporting and knows from his homework earnings will SUCK. The stock might be worth -$4 at this point. Might tank hard tomorrow.

`check RESTRICTIONS` from your brokerage before day trading, you could get stuck in a trade if they have certain limits. 

The `investory psychology` chart works on ALL TIMELINES by the way.

As price drops, and volume dwindles, people that buy at that low level near capitulation / anger / depression, the people that buy at this level are not panicking. As share price continues dropping less people want to sell. 

Falling back below `x` price we are back in the funnel.

`Algo alerts are BUY ONLY`

an `invest` alert is good for the next few weeks to months

Gaps:
`If gap down want to buy it generally, gap up sell it.`

`VWAP` another reason its useful. Reemmber it only works for intra-day trading (volumes less than 1d), so people that bought `TODAY`. When the average person buys TODAY logs into their account and refreshes for the 80th time and sees red numbers its from a death cross on the VWAP. The `vwap` indicates if the average person that bought today made or lost money which influences market sentimenet. A golden cross on `vwap` indicates average person that bought TODAY made money.

`cut, early signs of reversal (flat) then curl up`
