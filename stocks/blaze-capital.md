# Blaze Capital Trading Fundamentals

## Until proven otherwise, we are bullish. And conversely until proven otherwise we are bearish, rule of conservation of momentum. 

How can we make this a lesson instead of a failure? What can we do tomorrow to not repeat the same mistakes we made today. "Having a healthy relationship with failure is a modern day super power". Can't rely on other people what to do. Justin has a high level of win rates.

### Need to find 

- There was that one site you posted that had all major patterns and the predictive outcome based on, mights still be in bookmarks - historical analysis of which way the price will break. Find that
- buy walls / sell walls identifying volume, how to see it
- identifying where the bag holders are, are sell / buy walls part of this? probably
- fibs/Fibonacci levels
- 'paired' charts: if gold goes up this goes down, if oil goes down this goes up, if fed cuts interest this goes up this goes down
- if gold goes up this goes down, if oil goes down this goes up, if fed cuts interest this goes up this goes down
-  way to auto draw trendlines grabbing as many trendlines as possible (found script for this)
-  How do you set it up like in his video where you hide some of chart history (only show predefined range, then put down estimated trendlines, then hit play button to reveal actual chart history)
