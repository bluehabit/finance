## Until proven otherwise, we are bullish. And conversely until proven otherwise we are bearish, rule of conservation of momentum. 

How can we make this a lesson instead of a failure? What can we do tomorrow to not repeat the same mistakes we made today. "Having a healthy relationship with failure is a modern day super power". Can't rely on other people what to do. Justin has a high level of win rates.

### Need to find 

- There was that one site you posted that had all major patterns and the predictive outcome based on, mights still be in bookmarks - historical analysis of which way the price will break. Find that
- buy walls / sell walls identifying volume, how to see it
- identifying where the bag holders are, are sell / buy walls part of this? probably
- fibs/Fibonacci levels
- 'paired' charts: if gold goes up this goes down, if oil goes down this goes up, if fed cuts interest this goes up this goes down
- if gold goes up this goes down, if oil goes down this goes up, if fed cuts interest this goes up this goes down
-  way to auto draw trendlines grabbing as many trendlines as possible (found script for this)
-  How do you set it up like in his video where you hide some of chart history (only show predefined range, then put down estimated trendlines, then hit play button to reveal actual chart history)

On the weekend, Justin try to predict outcome of the market, what I use to predict. $’s try as bond yield starts to rise bonds and stocks start to look equally attractive. $’s try to go to two places stocks and bonds . Why is SPY important to the market? Im looking for a specific word. Its niagra falls as strong or weak as your individual stock may be, if niagra (index) is going downward longterm what happens to your individual fast boat. Your like yo got 2k hp speed boat im going up against niagra falls, up moves usually temporary. You can fight It, temporarily might fight it but you run out of gas what happens,  can throw down your anchor but what happens then eventually niagra pushes you off a cliff. There is a way to get an edge, we need to track SPY everyday to get an edge. Anything green today is unusual, why, market is red today and some stocks are green. By the way it took me nearly 3 years before I started tracking SPY, meaning how long was I not tracking before I actual did. So for 3 years flying blind, do you think I lost money, yes. I messed up bad, a failure, but I made it a lesson. Do you want to learn from my mistake or make it yourself? SPY is topdown spy is trying to figure out each of these individual boxes, each box is a category can track apple to tech, apple to the big box (SPY), apple to peers meaning is it outperforming the niagra falls. Do you think you have blind spots? SPY is an ETF SPX is the index. Justin yes I have blind spots, im saying with over 10 years trading I still have blind spots that’s why I like YOU GUYS spot checking each other, sharing ideas etc. At first I did this just to help, I needed people are around me, I still lose money sometimes. Why did I build a community, I human I make mistake. I started trading at 18 – 19, im now 32 years old. As bad as you think you are today I was worse than you, why I wanted to get better, and identified my mistakes. What im telling you if you suck have to do home work to do better next time, took me 5 years I need a plan to make money, if you did that in less than 5 years you got this. Why do you think im putting in so much effort quality of community on YT on slack is high, quality over quantity. Very difficult to find like minded individuals, most people just want hot tips all day and casinos. A lot of channels bigger than ours, why because ill take 1,000 good over 10k /r/wsb. Looking for quality questions and ideas because we all get better from that. Our mission statement is help you help yourself, I do this everyday because I want to get better, last step to get better mastery is teaching. Can I teach you what I know? Im being greedy when I do these streams. You need to be aware of the levels in your positions, again don’t assume that I think I know everything I have lots of blindspots. Part of our moto is. Plan the work, work the plan. watching my video might not be wholey sufficient, what gets measured gets improved so track your stuff **CHECK OUT THIS VIDEO https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4g6y-A2GIjM&ab_channel=BlazeCapital**
but i do market analysis and can summarize for you

Trying to do 3 years of knowledge in one stream

### Stock Chart Trend Lines - Support and Resistance Lines (Stock Market Basics)

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrlSdF167OI&ab_channel=BlazeCapital
Technical chart analysis is more reactive rather than predictive. Want to look at chart analysis to gauge different possible outcomes to have a plan for best care and worse case (stop loss, sell limit etc). Want to have a plan in place, enter / exit.

Think of stocks like physics, an object in motion will stay in motion until it encounters resistance. Resistance in this case will be either a **trend line or resistance / support line**, this is all based on human psychology. Resistance is where people want to sell the stock, where people try to buy is a support level. Eventually this comes to equilibrium and establishes ‘fair value’.

On candles the bodies are more ‘absolute’ testing, and the wicks and tails are usually tests of the **trendline or support / resistance line**.

![1](https://i.imgur.com/llhqTjv.png)

Don’t just buy because it hits a support line, as you can see here it loss quite a bit after this level after testing it several times.

![1](https://i.imgur.com/2jKh2lx.png)

![1](https://imgur.com/tMmElAy.png)

Don’t just blindly buy a support level and hope for the best, want to have a plan in place.
When you **manually** place these support / resistance levels, want to try and line up as many data points in the row as possible. The top of green are testing resistance, the bottom of red candles are testing support.

![1](https://i.imgur.com/GFQczOK.png)

Use **magnet tool** to help place these resistance / support bars easier

![1](https://i.imgur.com/4LuhZH7.png)

**Trend Lines**

![1](https://i.imgur.com/aCPHPf2.png)

These are manually placed as well again trying to line up as many data points as possible. Can always move these lines after placing them as well. 

![1](https://i.imgur.com/SMCY9Aw.png)

Now we are going to hit the replay button for the next 4-5 months to see how this chart looked with our trend lines and support / resistance lines

When lots of trades happen ABOVE where you currently are, we call that **overhead supply**, that means there are a lot of people that bought / traded up in this area. In these areas people typically want to get out so these become harder resistance lines to bust, makes it harder for a stock to go up, compared to something like bitcoin exponentially rising in uncharted territory with no previous history (once past the ATH). Lots of people can get **trapped** in these overhead supply areas.

![1](https://i.imgur.com/VWdKROi.png)

So as you can see, they are coming back to test the trendlines pretty frequently. Check out the one circled in red, hit exactly on our estimated trendline for support. **Top of wedge we drew is resistance, bottom of wedge is support.**

**How it actually happened**

![1](https://i.imgur.com/O9q6bif.png)

**Before we hit play button**

![1](https://imgur.com/3dGBZyJ.png)

As you can see did bounce off resistance, support lines quite a bit, so these help you define entries and exits and helps you develop a plan for success (put in stop losses etc).
Not going to be perfect everytime, just have to make educated guess that’s reasonably close. 
When you break through one direction, it becomes opposite, **So if you get over the top of resistance it becomes support, conversely, if you break below support, it becomes resistance.**

**I think this sort of shape is from trendlines is called a descending / ascending wedge, where breakouts happen**, in this case ascending wedge

t
(it’s the green candle in this image with the x marks on it)

About 10:38 This is a **hammer**, one of my favorite things to look for. Its when the body of the candle starts out of resistance, and then closes over the top of it, and then back tests below it. That’s a very bullish signal.

(chart) history doesn’t repeat itself but it rhymes

Parabolic charts are harder to do trend lines are, not enough trend lines (because your exponentially growing / in uncharted territory with no **overhead supply**

In general, if very focused on a couple stocks I like to look at **5 minute chart for entry** and have daily lines on and 5 minute ones as well, daily is good for entry / exit??? Wtf is he saying

Same ticker, **SPY** two charts

**Daily**
![1](https://imgur.com/vumZGXd.png)
**5 min**
![1](https://imgur.com/pf8hrGH.png)

Opening up 5 minute chart, can see from our trendlines drawn on the DAILY, resistance / support lines still hold up. Aka daily lines

**Support / Resistance lines kind of act like magnets**

![1](https://imgur.com/GiLA2v8.png)

Drawing our **down trend line** useful for day trades

Breakout, two scenarios have to be prepared for 

![1](https://i.imgur.com/p3cAsaS.png)

Looking for a break and hold, want to wait for confirmation. Where it breaks out. Ideally want it to breakout, then backtest down trend line to confirm – like this

![1](https://imgur.com/HWTSdR1.png)

Or conversely like this

![1](https://imgur.com/5iLrgj7.png)

**Draw trendlines**

![1](https://imgur.com/kcmhd1H.png)

**Add support resistance lines**

![1](https://imgur.com/hHkyGfx.png)

Don’t want to put too much on, grab as many data points as you can, try not to get chart noisy
Would consider this an **equilibrium channel**, not breaking support or resistance just bouncing back and forth aka **trading sideways**

![1](https://imgur.com/tm9MPwh.png)

**Going to wait for it to break one way or another before we make short or longterm plays**

Its getting very tight here near apex of triangle  / wedge, so have to wait and see what happens. He even posts this chart to the group

![1](https://imgur.com/E88nWrr.png)

Can pull trendlines from far away too like this one

![1](https://imgur.com/95sXg39.png)

![1](https://imgur.com/ErL7Fca.png)

What happened here? Did it bounce of a trendline, lets draw one and check it out

![1](https://imgur.com/tzGGiGt.png)

yup oh weird look at that
Can draw another mini trendline within , but this is almost going straight up so looks parabolic

•	Try to get as many lines on top as we can when drawing (collecting data points)
•	Looks reasonable there, then the bottom line
•	got quite a few touches here so im happy with how we drew this out 

![1](https://imgur.com/i2SNVWO.png)

•	with this kind of pattern we are looking for it to break and hold either over the uptrend or down trend line so we have two scenarios that you have to be prepared for 

![1](https://imgur.com/4s9mlk1.png)

•	In our drawing its contained within this wedge so its not ready to break out or break down yet, waiting for confirmation 
•	Scenario A looking for it to break out and back test the downtrend line 

![1](https://imgur.com/sCTFJjs.png)

•	 or conversely scenario B looking for it to break down, hit resistance, and then bounce back down again.

![1](https://imgur.com/LtyZu7A.png)

• Redrawing chart so less noise 

![1](https://imgur.com/Mhcc9VZ.png)

•	Would consider this equilibrium channel where it bounces back and forth before any plays, getting tight within wedge so should get a break out one way or another in the next week or two
•	Next Funko, this chart is pretty parabolic its gone straight up and straight down, can do longer trend level or shorter trend level for drawing, remember gathering as many data points as possible that’s reasonable

![1](https://imgur.com/tk91Oo5.png)

![1](https://imgur.com/twDDQYf.png)

•	Might consider this outlier information since the rest seems to be following this longer trend line 

![1](https://imgur.com/Fgo32Cl.png)

•	He is sending this basic analysis to the slack group … so it has value as basic as it is
•	New chart ianthus once again conservation of momentum going to continue current move until it hits support / resistance 

![1](https://imgur.com/lKlFENF.png)

•	Looks like trading view marks the prices that the support levels were drawn at automatically 

![1](https://imgur.com/cuQLzAU.png)

•	Ianthus, two really good hammers here so I treat that as support 

![1](https://imgur.com/lOpD4N6.png)

•	Drew trend resistance level where these two red candles almost perfectly match up, trying to draw trend lines resistance / support with matching candles of the same color, •	e.g. red and red, green and green. I think

![1](https://imgur.com/uLpmKT6.png)

•	Continuing to fill out the chart with more support resistance lines

![1](https://imgur.com/r9jSnfA.png)

![1](https://imgur.com/VxU9B6u.png)

•	Probably would not buy here, until it gets over this level because it has been strong support / resistance. Don’t want to buy here because risk reward here is not great. If you buy and it drops all the way down to here to $6.70 will lose money if don’t have a proper stop loss in place.

![1](https://imgur.com/mTJljfG.png)

•	If we draw it another way like this, looks like we broke the down trend line

### From Stock Options Basics Introduction [Stock Market Education]

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MP2Km8qusgE&list=PL6o37jvhqx9a3Uvgs4QZKWA-SBARBKLxI&index=1&t=7s&ab_channel=BlazeCapital

•	Much more risk with options, total $ value risk is lower but the probability of losing all of your investment or 50% of your investment is a lot higher. When you buy an option generally want mentality going in that it can possibly go to zero to be prepared for that risk. **Options** are **puts** and **calls**. 
•	What I recommend doing is paper trading which is to say you write down which options you want to buy on paper, excel file, etc. for practice and see how you would perform had it been real money
•	Going to do a live demonstration using Amazon

![1](https://imgur.com/IbgcapF.png)

•	Write now current stock price is $1,786.80 so we will buy one call $1760 and you trade these just like you would a stock, going to do market buy because its not real money

![1](https://imgur.com/jiKbszD.png)

•	Now our put  at $1805.00

![1](https://imgur.com/2nhPoo1.png)

![1](https://imgur.com/2QnxiD0.png)

•	Can see are calls / puts here
•	Amazon is a high value stock so these options will move faster versus a lower dollar value stock like $20, so these options should move fast, and with real money amazon type companies would be really good if right, but quite bad if wrong
•	An option is basically a **bet** from one person to another person that they know which direction the stocks going to or a way to hedge part of their portfolio using **covered calls** which require a **premium**. People pay the premium in order to get an option from the other person. One contract is equal to 100 shares. *A put is a bet that the stock price will go down, so you get the right to sell the security (stock) at a certain price and then a call is the opposite, you get the option to buy the contract at a certain price. These options have a date stamp on them which makes them more risky, because if you are wrong at a certain time your option price could go to zero. With a stock can hold onto it indefinitely if you want and it could go back up, but an option, if you’re wrong in a certain span of time it goes to zero and you get nothing for it.*

![1](https://imgur.com/XZjs836.png)

![1](https://imgur.com/TLYgISa.png)

•	The ones we bought for Amazon were June 7th 

![1](https://imgur.com/Ilkkonf.png)

•	So these bets (options) are that the stock are going to be above (call) or below (put) these specified prices, normally you wouldn’t buy an option both ways (bull/bear) unless the market is super volatile at that point in time, in which you could get the direction right both ways. Rather, you pick a trend you think the stock is going to go (up or down) and use a put or call accordingly


#### Option Chain

•	The person who sold the contracts is betting or hedging their portfolio the opposite direction. When we are watching the **option chain** look and see there is a lot of open interest. So if there is a bunch of contracts open at a certain time frame there is one person betting that the stock price is going, so say for example we are looking at $1785 as a target price there is one person betting the stock price is going to go above that, and there going to get to catch the difference from the calls, and then the other person who sold the option contract originally is betting that the price is going to be below, because they don’t want to give their shares away they just want to collect the option premium and keep their shares ideally. That’s why its really hard to figure out whats happening because there are two people betting on this, and you don’t know who has the biggest pockets so we don’t know if price is going to be above or below that.
•	Lol (matt) he had to pull out calculator to do 178 x 100 

![1](https://imgur.com/AzwqNOj.png)

![1](https://imgur.com/EjiuMBb.png)

•	So when I was talking about risk/reward in order to buy **100 amazon contracts**, remember **ONE CONTRACT is 100 SHARES** its going to be **a lot** of money in this case $178,000 for 100 shares, **where as we just bought 100 contracts of each for about $8,010** ($4,215 + 3,795 below), also can see we already lost 270 on our call side. And profiting 20 on the put side. In general expect that the option could go to zero that way not as stressful. Because they literally move so fast ive made lots of money in options but also lost quite a bit as well. Again strongly recommend paper trading until you get a better feel for it because can lose money so fast in options. I also would recommend something that doesn’t normally move that fast like the s&p500

![1](https://imgur.com/8lvVdt3.png)

•	Going to go over **option chain** and how to read it. The left side is calls, the right side is puts. We have bid and the ask this is the same as trading stocks have to be careful because spread on options can get big and your multiplying that by 100 so if your buying 10 contracts and your paying 50 cent difference that’s $500. So want to be careful on your bids and your ask. 

•	10 contracts x 100 shares per = 1,000 x .50 cents = $500
•	 ideally want to be getting your bid filled but depends on your time frame, for example **when I day trade I usually just hit market (is that a button like you used on binance to instant sell?)**, so generally I use `market orders`, if im using a longer term option trade like a few months out then probably will want to do a limit fill because then getting difference if getting a lower fill.
