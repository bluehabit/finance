## Triple Top aka W Pattern

3 peaks at nearly the same price level,
the area of peak is resistance. A triple top signals that the asset may no longer be rallying and that lower prices may be on the way

The pullbacks between the peaks are callled swing lows.After the third peak if the price falls below the swing low, the pattern is considered complete
and traders watch for a futher move to the downside. Triple tops are traded in the same manner generally as a head and shoulders pattern.

Technically, a tripple top pattern shows the price is UNABLE to PENETRATE the area of the peaks. Generally means asset is unable to find many buyers in that price range. As the price falls, it puts pressure on those who bought near the peak. If the price can't rise above resistance there is limited profit potential in holding onto it.

The following chart shows an example of a triple top in Bruker Corp. (BRKR). The price reaches near $36.50 on three consecutive attempts. The price pulls back between each attempt, creating the triple top pattern. The stock quickly broke below trendline support at $34 and continued to decline on escalating volume.

## Until proven otherwise, we are bullish. And conversely until proven otherwise we are bearish, rule of conservation of momentum. 

How can we make this a lesson instead of a failure? What can we do tomorrow to not repeat the same mistakes we made today. "Having a healthy relationship with failure is a modern day super power". Can't rely on other people what to do. Justin has a high level of win rates.

### Need to find 

- There was that one site you posted that had all major patterns and the predictive outcome based on, mights still be in bookmarks - historical analysis of which way the price will break. Find that
- buy walls / sell walls identifying volume, how to see it
- identifying where the bag holders are, are sell / buy walls part of this? probably
- fibs/Fibonacci levels
- 'paired' charts: if gold goes up this goes down, if oil goes down this goes up, if fed cuts interest this goes up this goes down
- if gold goes up this goes down, if oil goes down this goes up, if fed cuts interest this goes up this goes down
-  way to auto draw trendlines grabbing as many trendlines as possible (found script for this)
-  How do you set it up like in his video where you hide some of chart history (only show predefined range, then put down estimated trendlines, then hit play button to reveal actual chart history)

On the weekend, Justin try to predict outcome of the market, what I use to predict. $’s try as bond yield starts to rise bonds and stocks start to look equally attractive. $’s try to go to two places stocks and bonds . Why is SPY important to the market? Im looking for a specific word. Its niagra falls as strong or weak as your individual stock may be, if niagra (index) is going downward longterm what happens to your individual fast boat. Your like yo got 2k hp speed boat im going up against niagra falls, up moves usually temporary. You can fight It, temporarily might fight it but you run out of gas what happens,  can throw down your anchor but what happens then eventually niagra pushes you off a cliff. There is a way to get an edge, we need to track SPY everyday to get an edge. Anything green today is unusual, why, market is red today and some stocks are green. By the way it took me nearly 3 years before I started tracking SPY, meaning how long was I not tracking before I actual did. So for 3 years flying blind, do you think I lost money, yes. I messed up bad, a failure, but I made it a lesson. Do you want to learn from my mistake or make it yourself? SPY is topdown spy is trying to figure out each of these individual boxes, each box is a category can track apple to tech, apple to the big box (SPY), apple to peers meaning is it outperforming the niagra falls. Do you think you have blind spots? SPY is an ETF SPX is the index. Justin yes I have blind spots, im saying with over 10 years trading I still have blind spots that’s why I like YOU GUYS spot checking each other, sharing ideas etc. At first I did this just to help, I needed people are around me, I still lose money sometimes. Why did I build a community, I human I make mistake. I started trading at 18 – 19, im now 32 years old. As bad as you think you are today I was worse than you, why I wanted to get better, and identified my mistakes. What im telling you if you suck have to do home work to do better next time, took me 5 years I need a plan to make money, if you did that in less than 5 years you got this. Why do you think im putting in so much effort quality of community on YT on slack is high, quality over quantity. Very difficult to find like minded individuals, most people just want hot tips all day and casinos. A lot of channels bigger than ours, why because ill take 1,000 good over 10k /r/wsb. Looking for quality questions and ideas because we all get better from that. Our mission statement is help you help yourself, I do this everyday because I want to get better, last step to get better mastery is teaching. Can I teach you what I know? Im being greedy when I do these streams. You need to be aware of the levels in your positions, again don’t assume that I think I know everything I have lots of blindspots. Part of our moto is.

### Stock Chart Trend Lines - Support and Resistance Lines (Stock Market Basics)

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrlSdF167OI&ab_channel=BlazeCapital
Technical chart analysis is more reactive rather than predictive. Want to look at chart analysis to gauge different possible outcomes to have a plan for best care and worse case (stop loss, sell limit etc). Want to have a plan in place, enter / exit.

Think of stocks like physics, an object in motion will stay in motion until it encounters resistance. Resistance in this case will be either a **trend line or resistance / support line**, this is all based on human psychology. Resistance is where people want to sell the stock, where people try to buy is a support level. Eventually this comes to equilibrium and establishes ‘fair value’.

On candles the bodies are more ‘absolute’ testing, and the wicks and tails are usually tests of the **trendline or support / resistance line**.

![1](https://i.imgur.com/llhqTjv.png)

Don’t just buy because it hits a support line, as you can see here it loss quite a bit after this level after testing it several times.

![1](https://i.imgur.com/2jKh2lx.png)

![1](https://imgur.com/tMmElAy.png)

Don’t just blindly buy a support level and hope for the best, want to have a plan in place.
When you **manually** place these support / resistance levels, want to try and line up as many data points in the row as possible. The top of green are testing resistance, the bottom of red candles are testing support.

![1](https://i.imgur.com/GFQczOK.png)

Use **magnet tool** to help place these resistance / support bars easier

![1](https://i.imgur.com/4LuhZH7.png)

**Trend Lines**

![1](https://i.imgur.com/aCPHPf2.png)

These are manually placed as well again trying to line up as many data points as possible. Can always move these lines after placing them as well. 

![1](https://i.imgur.com/SMCY9Aw.png)

Now we are going to hit the replay button for the next 4-5 months to see how this chart looked with our trend lines and support / resistance lines

When lots of trades happen ABOVE where you currently are, we call that **overhead supply**, that means there are a lot of people that bought / traded up in this area. In these areas people typically want to get out so these become harder resistance lines to bust, makes it harder for a stock to go up, compared to something like bitcoin exponentially rising in uncharted territory with no previous history (once past the ATH). Lots of people can get **trapped** in these overhead supply areas.

![1](https://i.imgur.com/VWdKROi.png)

So as you can see, they are coming back to test the trendlines pretty frequently. Check out the one circled in red, hit exactly on our estimated trendline for support. **Top of wedge we drew is resistance, bottom of wedge is support.**

**How it actually happened**

![1](https://i.imgur.com/O9q6bif.png)

**Before we hit play button**

![1](https://imgur.com/3dGBZyJ.png)

As you can see did bounce off resistance, support lines quite a bit, so these help you define entries and exits and helps you develop a plan for success (put in stop losses etc).
Not going to be perfect everytime, just have to make educated guess that’s reasonably close. 
When you break through one direction, it becomes opposite, **So if you get over the top of resistance it becomes support, conversely, if you break below support, it becomes resistance.**

**I think this sort of shape is from trendlines is called a descending / ascending wedge, where breakouts happen**, in this case ascending wedge

![1](https://imgur.com/j4oqNNo.png)

![1](https://imgur.com/STVynfU.png)
t
(it’s the green candle in this image with the x marks on it)

About 10:38 This is a **hammer**, one of my favorite things to look for. Its when the body of the candle starts out of resistance, and then closes over the top of it, and then back tests below it. That’s a very bullish signal.

(chart) history doesn’t repeat itself but it rhymes

Parabolic charts are harder to do trend lines are, not enough trend lines (because your exponentially growing / in uncharted territory with no **overhead supply**

In general, if very focused on a couple stocks I like to look at **5 minute chart for entry** and have daily lines on and 5 minute ones as well, daily is good for entry / exit??? Wtf is he saying

Same ticker, **SPY** two charts

**Daily**
![1](https://imgur.com/vumZGXd.png)
**5 min**
![1](https://imgur.com/pf8hrGH.png)

Opening up 5 minute chart, can see from our trendlines drawn on the DAILY, resistance / support lines still hold up. Aka daily lines

**Support / Resistance lines kind of act like magnets**

Breakout, two scenarios have to be prepared for 

![1](https://i.imgur.com/p3cAsaS.png)

Looking for a break and hold, want to wait for confirmation. Where it breaks out. Ideally want it to breakout, then backtest down trend line to confirm – like this

![1](https://imgur.com/HWTSdR1.png)

Or conversely like this

![1](https://imgur.com/5iLrgj7.png)

**Draw trendlines**

![1](https://imgur.com/kcmhd1H.png)

**Add support resistance lines**

![1](https://imgur.com/hHkyGfx.png)

Don’t want to put too much on, grab as many data points as you can, try not to get chart noisy
Would consider this an **equilibrium channel**, not breaking support or resistance just bouncing back and forth aka **trading sideways**

![1](https://imgur.com/tm9MPwh.png)

**Going to wait for it to break one way or another before we make short or longterm plays**

Its getting very tight here near apex of triangle  / wedge, so have to wait and see what happens. He even posts this chart to the group

yup oh weird look at that
Can draw another mini trendline within , but this is almost going straight up so looks parabolic

•	Try to get as many lines on top as we can when drawing (collecting data points)
•	Looks reasonable there, then the bottom line
•	got quite a few touches here so im happy with how we drew this out 

![1](https://imgur.com/i2SNVWO.png)

•	with this kind of pattern we are looking for it to break and hold either over the uptrend or down trend line so we have two scenarios that you have to be prepared for 

![1](https://imgur.com/4s9mlk1.png)

•	In our drawing its contained within this wedge so its not ready to break out or break down yet, waiting for confirmation 
•	Scenario A looking for it to break out and back test the downtrend line 

![1](https://imgur.com/sCTFJjs.png)

•	 or conversely scenario B looking for it to break down, hit resistance, and then bounce back down again.

![1](https://imgur.com/LtyZu7A.png)

• Redrawing chart so less noise 

![1](https://imgur.com/Mhcc9VZ.png)

•	Would consider this equilibrium channel where it bounces back and forth before any plays, getting tight within wedge so should get a break out one way or another in the next week or two
•	Next Funko, this chart is pretty parabolic its gone straight up and straight down, can do longer trend level or shorter trend level for drawing, remember gathering as many data points as possible that’s reasonable

![1](https://imgur.com/tk91Oo5.png)

![1](https://imgur.com/twDDQYf.png)

•	Might consider this outlier information since the rest seems to be following this longer trend line 

![1](https://imgur.com/Fgo32Cl.png)

•	He is sending this basic analysis to the slack group … so it has value as basic as it is
•	New chart ianthus once again conservation of momentum going to continue current move until it hits support / resistance 

![1](https://imgur.com/lKlFENF.png)

•	Looks like trading view marks the prices that the support levels were drawn at automatically 

![1](https://imgur.com/cuQLzAU.png)

•	Ianthus, two really good hammers here so I treat that as support 

![1](https://imgur.com/lOpD4N6.png)

•	Drew trend resistance level where these two red candles almost perfectly match up, trying to draw trend lines resistance / support with matching candles of the same color, •	e.g. red and red, green and green. I think

![1](https://imgur.com/uLpmKT6.png)

•	Continuing to fill out the chart with more support resistance lines

![1](https://imgur.com/r9jSnfA.png)

![1](https://imgur.com/VxU9B6u.png)

•	Probably would not buy here, until it gets over this level because it has been strong support / resistance. Don’t want to buy here because risk reward here is not great. If you buy and it drops all the way down to here to $6.70 will lose money if don’t have a proper stop loss in place.

![1](https://imgur.com/mTJljfG.png)

•	If we draw it another way like this, looks like we broke the down trend line

### From Stock Options Basics Introduction [Stock Market Education]

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MP2Km8qusgE&list=PL6o37jvhqx9a3Uvgs4QZKWA-SBARBKLxI&index=1&t=7s&ab_channel=BlazeCapital

* Much more risk with options, total $ value risk is lower but the probability of losing all of your investment or 50% of your investment is a lot higher. When you buy an option generally want mentality going in that it can possibly go to zero to be prepared for that risk. **Options** are **puts** and **calls**. 
*	What I recommend doing is paper trading which is to say you write down which options you want to buy on paper, excel file, etc. for practice and see how you would perform had it been real money
* Going to do a live demonstration using Amazon

![1](https://imgur.com/IbgcapF.png)

•	Write now current stock price is $1,786.80 so we will buy one call $1760 and you trade these just like you would a stock, going to do market buy because its not real money

![1](https://imgur.com/jiKbszD.png)

•	Now our put  at $1805.00

![1](https://imgur.com/2nhPoo1.png)

![1](https://imgur.com/2QnxiD0.png)

## PUT

*	Can see are calls / puts here
*	Amazon is a high value stock so these options will move faster versus a lower dollar value stock like $20, so these options should move fast, and with real money amazon type companies would be really good if right, but quite bad if wrong
*	An option is basically a **bet** from one person to another person that they know which direction the stocks going to or a way to hedge part of their portfolio using **covered calls** which require a **premium**. People pay the premium in order to get an option from the other person. One contract is equal to 100 shares. 
* A put is a bet that the stock price will go down, so you get the right to sell the security (stock) at a certain price and then a call is the opposite, you get the option to buy the contract at a certain price. These options have a date stamp on them which makes them more risky, because if you are wrong at a certain time your option price could go to zero. With a stock can hold onto it indefinitely if you want and it could go back up, but an option, if you’re wrong in a certain span of time it goes to zero and you get nothing for it.*

![1](https://imgur.com/XZjs836.png)

![1](https://imgur.com/TLYgISa.png)

•	The ones we bought for Amazon were June 7th 

![1](https://imgur.com/Ilkkonf.png)

•	So these bets (options) are that the stock are going to be above (call) or below (put) these specified prices, normally you wouldn’t buy an option both ways (bull/bear) unless the market is super volatile at that point in time, in which you could get the direction right both ways. Rather, you pick a trend you think the stock is going to go (up or down) and use a put or call accordingly


#### Option Chain

•	The person who sold the contracts is betting or hedging their portfolio the opposite direction. When we are watching the **option chain** look and see there is a lot of open interest. So if there is a bunch of contracts open at a certain time frame there is one person betting that the stock price is going, so say for example we are looking at $1785 as a target price there is one person betting the stock price is going to go above that, and there going to get to catch the difference from the calls, and then the other person who sold the option contract originally is betting that the price is going to be below, because they don’t want to give their shares away they just want to collect the option premium and keep their shares ideally. That’s why its really hard to figure out whats happening because there are two people betting on this, and you don’t know who has the biggest pockets so we don’t know if price is going to be above or below that.
•	Lol (matt) he had to pull out calculator to do 178 x 100 

![1](https://imgur.com/AzwqNOj.png)

![1](https://imgur.com/EjiuMBb.png)

•	So when I was talking about risk/reward in order to buy **100 amazon contracts**, remember **ONE CONTRACT is 100 SHARES** its going to be **a lot** of money in this case $178,000 for 100 shares, **where as we just bought 100 contracts of each for about $8,010** ($4,215 + 3,795 below), also can see we already lost 270 on our call side. And profiting 20 on the put side. In general expect that the option could go to zero that way not as stressful. Because they literally move so fast ive made lots of money in options but also lost quite a bit as well. Again strongly recommend paper trading until you get a better feel for it because can lose money so fast in options. I also would recommend something that doesn’t normally move that fast like the s&p500

![1](https://imgur.com/8lvVdt3.png)

•	Going to go over **option chain** and how to read it. The left side is calls, the right side is puts. We have bid and the ask this is the same as trading stocks have to be careful because spread on options can get big and your multiplying that by 100 so if your buying 10 contracts and your paying 50 cent difference that’s $500. So want to be careful on your bids and your ask. 

•	10 contracts x 100 shares per = 1,000 x .50 cents = $500
•	 ideally want to be getting your bid filled but depends on your time frame, for example **when I day trade I usually just hit market (is that a button like you used on binance to instant sell?)**, so generally I use `market orders`, if im using a longer term option trade like a few months out then probably will want to do a limit fill because then getting difference if getting a lower fill. 

![1](https://imgur.com/QI55HZh.png)

•	`Volume` is the volume per day, want to watch for example trading s&p 500 and there is a whole pile of volume on the 275 put options or something, keep in mind people who want price below that but since its option there is the other side that wants price above that too. You never really know, it just can add more information to your hypothesis.
•	`Open interest` is the amount of contracts that have not been settled. Sometimes those numbers can be really big like 10,000 – 30,000 open interest at a certain price. Again don’t know if someone wants to get that price above or below it but it’s another number to keep in mind, depends on who all owns those contracts etc. With high open interest numbers can serve as a magnet to that price. 
•	`Implied Volatility` this is the premium, the premium is the risk you are paying the option seller in order to give up the option, no one is going to give up option for $0 or else they are not going to make any money.  These next 3 numbers all add up. The implied volatility is a percentage which has the premium they’re paying on top. If volatility is higher people are usually more willing to pay more of a premium, this is usually tied to the VIX and all that sort of stuff.
•	`delta` is the ratio that the option is going to change in relation to the stock price. When I did my initial put and call options I was trying to get a delta closer to 0,  because when you get closer to 1 the underlying price is going to move $1 for $1 with the stock. The options that are closer to the actual trading price are closer to the actual trading price for example .5 or .6 which means you are going to get half a move (.5) in the option price for every $1

![1](https://imgur.com/ATir906.png)

•	If we open **all strikes** can see what the **delta** is for the ones that we bought , we got about a .7 on the call side so for every $1 we get a decimal .7 move in our option price

![1](https://imgur.com/m4syrQ5.png)

•	`Theta` is the time decay, so when justin is talking about premium burning and that type of thing on options he is talking about theta decay this happens a lot quicker when closer to expiration dates, if you’re a few weeks out on the contract the effect is a lot smaller. When theta is burning there is usually someone who sold the option contract and they are trying to get to rebuy these contracts again at a lower price, so they let the theta burn down and rebuy the options that they sold for a cheaper price and at the difference. So that’s what happens when they are kind of pinning the price in the middle of the day on Friday, or conversely trying to drive it down by calls cheaper and then driving it back up
•	Its really hard to determine what they are trying to do but justin is really good at doing it. That’s how he can call out some of those closes sometimes.
•	When im trading options I go close to in the `money (whats this mean)` depending on what I am trading, usually like a few $ away or at the money depending on which day it is. And then I either buy the closest Friday or the following Friday – that is for like day trading just because you get a lot of movement, and the prices are cheaper. If you are going to do this with some of these bigger companies its going to cost a fortune because your paying for the theta, time value risk, from your option price. So sometimes paying like $1,000 per contract etc. So sometimes doesn’t make sense to buy that far out. Whereas if we buy a contract that is maybe a month or two away we don’t want to lose our shirt on that time decay so ill buy it out 1 or 2 months away and then I usually buy out of the money. **A few grand vs 10s of thousands of dollars, what that mean in contracts?**
•	Lots of strategies in options for example there is a `straddle` is buying option at set price where you try to cover losses with covered call. A `strangle` buy a put call roughly equidistant from the strike price, trying to make money on one side but also protect yourself on the otherside 
•	Can use as a hedge as mentioned for example if your long on indexes can buy puts on SPY etc. to protect yourself on the downside
•	So in summary find open interest, hints as to where price might go, implied volatility is the expected move and premium people are paying for that. If you go look at a stock that has earnings due volatility is going to be up in the 100-200% and then after earnings happen it drops significantly, that’s why betting on earnings is not the best because if your trying to do a straddle and you do one of each you are going to lose a lot of theta just based on volatility so really hard to make money on earnings unless right because losing value on both ends. Delta is change on option pricing in relation to stock price, theta is the time premium associated with the stock

going into close if average person is a loser more likely to sell than if they are making money

•	`VWAP is volume weighted average price` Some people use for day trading and enters / exits. Calculated by taking $s traded for every transaction and then multiplied by number of shares traded and divided by total number of trades traded.

![1](https://imgur.com/Y0ZCumh.png)

•	So what does this tell us? Gives us a good indication on price and volume which are both very important indicators. **Its only available intraday, so if you go to the daily chart it will not show up properly!** The reason being its calculated mid reset everyday at the open. He is using 5min chart here, is anything less than a day ok to use for VWAP?
•	 You cant rely soley on the vwap however it is a very important tool but ill explain that as I go. Gives us lots of information with 1 line. Its bullish if uptrending above the line and bearish below. `VWAP (price and volume)` is different from `VMA (volume)` which is just volume moving average, no price action included. Is VMA the same as 5, 30 day moving average? Also serves as support / resistance so usually good place to take  profits or initiate entries

•	If it crosses under the VWAP and cant hold it not a good sign, so for example here we GAP up and then crossed under VWAP and sank most of the day here.  (insert figure 2), vwap tends to serve as a `magnet` . If above bullish / below bearish, supports resistance support pretty well, using as a tool to take profits or using as stop loss. Don’t want to rely on this solely  - `want to combine with bollinger bands, good old manually drawn support resistance lines/trend lines`

![1](https://imgur.com/UHWu2UI.png)

•	So using above example wouldn’t want to be initiating calls under this trend line because risk reward ratio is not great, versus below example

![1](https://imgur.com/mrhVdbk.png)

•	Good old regular support / resistance lines also serve as a `magnet`
•	Figure 4 goes below, from these sort of big moves ive learned in the past hard to chase big moves like this because don’t know whats going to happen. Sometimes they go up hit `Bollinger bans` smash into the ceiling and plummet down
•	Back testing is usually support somewhere if you scroll back on the graph and can’t immediately see it.

#### Difference Between EMA, SMA and Bollinger Bands (Stock Market Indicators

On your tradingview scripts this one is the `7, 30, 50, 100, 200 day simple moving averages`

`The mid brown line on the bollinger band is a 5 day SMA!`

script

![1](https://imgur.com/tekDinn.png)

#### SMA LEGEND

### SMAs can serve as support/resistance lines as well. 

20 - very short term
50 - short term
100 - medium term
200 - long term

![1](https://i.imgur.com/sNcf6eM.png)

•	Simple moving average (`SMA`) and exponential Moving average (`EMA`). The simple moving average is calculated just by adding the closing prices by the day, so if you have a 10 day sma you will add all 10 then divide by 10 to get the average. EMA is a more complicated equation but overall tends to smooth out the price action a bit, most people use `SMA for larger time periods like the daily`, people use all sorts of different days to measure SMA it just depends on what works for you, in his example he is using the 50 (black), 100 day (red), and 200 blue

![1](https://imgur.com/UJLj1vo.png)

•	This is called a `death cross` when the `lower moving average crosses over the larger moving average`, and conversely when moving other way it is called the `golden cross` see 

![1](https://imgur.com/1mMP7RC.png)

![1](https://imgur.com/SYDFNKr.png)

![1](https://imgur.com/wBIBycD.png)

•	I primarily use exponential moving average (matt) because I do more short period time frames, im on the 5 minute chart I use the 5 and 10 day moving average it all comes down to what you can replicate good results from so its personal preference
•	![1](https://imgur.com/0PJLCti.png)
• ![1](https://imgur.com/yvUSiUa.png)
•	You are not going to catch the whole move everytime that’s not realistic but it can give you an idea on trend
•	F![1](https://imgur.com/2kjDrA6.png) 
• ![1](https://imgur.com/UXbBDHm.png)
•	Moving average will not always work 100%  price dropped the floor with no crossing of SMA 

![1](https://imgur.com/Jryc7y1.png)

•	If you did nothing else but wait for SMA crosses would have pretty good success. 
•	Here had a gap up, sank all day and had to fill this gap here, and then continued upward, that happens quite frequently as well. For all of this we have 3-4 outcomes. When have a gap up we either sink back, gap fill. 

![1](https://imgur.com/Fx4CYU8.png)

![1](https://imgur.com/WCzgYNq.png)

•	sink and trend downward, here we gap up, sink, fill the gap, and kept going down ![1](https://imgur.com/KEuMwwN.png)
•	or we gap up, test the blue sma and then continue upwards fig ![1](https://imgur.com/t5uw6Y3.png)
•	gap down, either consolidate sidewaysthen  go up,  ![1](https://imgur.com/KXxlWSn.png)
•	or gap down and continue dropping, probably would not buy here because its riding the underside of the sma current in the middle of a death cross
![1](https://imgur.com/yUaZGq5.png)
•	last example is gap down and then head upwards 
![1](https://imgur.com/NQWobh6.png)
•	so generally what I do is wait for the **Bollinger bands to get pierced**  one way or another for a buy or sell and combine that with SMA moving averages to determine bullish or bearishness

### Intro To RSI and Stochastic [Overbought and Oversold Indicators]

### RSI 

• Momentum indicators, RSI relative strenght indicator, and stochastic oscillator determine overbought and oversold conditions will hear justin say have to cool off indicators, what that means need to get from overbought to oversold. Not defenitive.  `Overbought is around 70+ rsi` `oversold below 30`. Things can remain 'overbought' or 'oversold' much longer than you think they can, but just because within a threshold does not meach it will flip the other way
![1](https://imgur.com/llIYfWJ.png)

* RSI will rise as the number and size of positive closes increases, and will fall as number and size of losses increase
* What we are watching for is it to go up into these ranges and then turn around, when we `get up into this range want to start looking into potentially taking profits`, but want to wait for **confirmation** before you do so, like how a **back test** serves as **confirmation**
* ![1](https://imgur.com/mWi43sf.png)
* More **volatile stocks** `will have higher and lower RSI values` where as s&p trends indicators alot more strictly since there are a lot more people watching it
* so at this area want to drop a some **support and resistance lines**, one of my next videos is how to combine all these indicators together. So RSI can fall thats one indicator of downward pressure, then can see a death cross, another sign of downward pressure which further confirms whats happening, and once we confirm this support here we want to exit or short.
* `can even draw trend lines on the RSI if you want`
* Here is a more recent section of S&P500 from december
* ![1](https://imgur.com/6ByvBlf.png)
* the smaller the time frame the less of the size of the move to make a profit on, for example doing hourly or per day its a small time frame so 5% might be what you can get vs going long where easier to get something like 20% over time
* ![1](https://imgur.com/De0iwWv.png)

### Stochastic
* sensitive to momentum rather than absolute price, operates on assumption that closing prices should close near same direction as current trend
* generally consists 2 lines, `one reflects actual value of oscilator the other reflecting the 3 day simple moving average, bull and bear wicks, crossing over vwop`
* becuase price is thought to follow momentum, so the intersection of lines may indicate a **reversal** is in play. Looking for blue line to cross the red line upwards in overbought or oversold conditions. When it gets close to `0`, `5`, `6`, etc thats a pretty good chance will turn back the other way. `Only issue with this, and other variables we use to measure the market is yoru going to get alot of false positives and false negatives if taken alone in isolation` - so want to use in combination with other things on the chart such as support and resistance lines, RSI and stochastic together, moving averages gives you a more complete picture you are like a detective gathering evidence.
* Below is a good example of RSI/Stochastic remaining in overbought or oversold conditions longer than you anticipate, we were here for 3 months ![1](https://imgur.com/TUdAN0F.png)
* ![1](https://imgur.com/B7fKMU2.png)
* Some people do whats called a `snake bid`? where they throw a bid down at one of the support levels and just wait for it to fill, gives you pretty good risk reward here, maybe a 10 or 15 cent stop loss below that (like at that pierced bollinger band)

#### Trading View Tutorial [Stock Market]

* I think 5 is limit for indicators for pro version, for data just took out TSX from free version, I paid for that its only $9 and worth it, also pay for american exchange because company they use is slightly delayed and when your trading S&P options it moves so fast the delay can cost you thousands of dollars or more.
* Main indicators I use are 5 and 10 day moving average, bollinger bands (2nd and 3rd deviation), Stochastic and RSI also VWOP on 5 minute
* adding bollinger bands ![1](https://imgur.com/sykks6s.png)
* configuring it ![1](https://imgur.com/P6AEgik.png) although matt likes to use **standard deviation of 3 as preference (not pictured)**
* Always want to wait for **confirmation** but how do that
* `The mid brown line on the bollinger band is a 5 day SMA`
* matt does mostly day trading so does the 5 and 10 day SMA, but usually uses the `EMA` which is also built in ![1](https://imgur.com/IXIb9o4.png)
* can change colors so its easier to see ![1](https://imgur.com/6WOnFM1.png)
* ` usually use death / goldlen cross to CONFIRM price direction`
* right click to add an alert ![1](https://imgur.com/PCVP4yj.png)
* refines alert with crossing up or down says doesn't really matter, can make alert for up and down 
* ![1](https://imgur.com/eHW0KDL.png), can set it for price or anything else
* Can use magnet tool to help align on support lines automatically ![1](https://imgur.com/undefined.png)
* Can change visibility so some parameters only show up if under certain parameters ![1](https://imgur.com/vfH0QWa.png) double click on things like the trend lines to get this option
* Compare button ![1](https://imgur.com/ZVNCbWQ.png) for example can look at apple compared to s&p500 ![1](https://imgur.com/YjPH48x.png)
* can view multiple charts on one time frame if you want ![1](https://imgur.com/F391FfR.png)
* can `share` ![1](https://imgur.com/J73kiBa.png)
* if you want to draw a lot of trend lines all at once ![1](https://imgur.com/mR4hyRE.png)

#### Stock Trading Order Types (Overview)

#### Market Order 
* S&P one of most widely traded, easy to get in and out, very liquid. 
* Level 1 bid and ask price different on level 1 different than level 2.  With level 1 called *lots* and these are multiples aof 100. The number by bid size is multiplied by 100. Some brokers different than others, might not always be like that. But usually level 2 is actually share count themselves. But in the case of QUEST TRADE
* ![1](https://imgur.com/RrdjxhO.png)
* ![1](https://imgur.com/sEUCOj4.png)
* Why is this important, because depending on what you are trading will choose a different type of order. With S&P im always confident with market orders, but your going to want to check the spread though, I trade a lot of options and sometimes the spread can be 10 or 20 cents which can be hundreds of dollars, so you dont just go in and smash the buy button just want to confirm before you buy. But for trading shares most of the time you are going to get a pretty big fill. 
* When determining if buying or selling want to look at level 2, so if i was going to sell 50,000 shares right now, it would EAT ALL these shares up. If you scroll down there is maybe 20,000 bids in ![1](https://imgur.com/Xi3QXXy.png) at market, if I was selling at 1.55 going to get filled at 1.55 right? nope, going all the way down to probably in the 1.30s judging by how many bids are in (left bid/buy, right ask/sell)
* Same thing on the ask side. 
* So I was watching this one day, and somebody hit market sell here and dropped price all the way down to here.So say you had 50 or 100k shares and you said GET ME OUT and you hit market, it eats up all the bids all the way down here. And then the price gets driven back up because good price at the time and people 'bought the dip' driving the price up. If you hit market on that your avereage sell price probably went way down, probably got $2 or so where as you probably wanted $3 or so. Thats why we dont hit market on **small caps** unless your paying attention to the level 2 and know for certain going to get filled and not going to eat up all the bids depending going up or down depending if you are selling or buying
* ![1](https://imgur.com/zsuUog6.png)
* With large caps, usually ok to trade canopy, s&p etc, only going to get variance of a couple pennies in your market sell, whereas if doing small caps its going smash the ask/sell in whichever direction your doing it if its a large amount of dollars

#### Limit Order
* Othe type is a `limit order`, use s&p as example trading in 290.05 ish and if your buying 100 its not going to make a huge difference, lets hit buy, I got filled at 290.10
* ![1](https://imgur.com/iKsZLWg.png)
* downside to limit orders, if you miss where the price is, so lets say i put in a bid for 210 right now, and someone selling at 290.5 not going to get filled. If you really want to get filled, want to put limit slightly above where ask is or at ask, and if you dont might not get filled properly.


#### Stop Losses
#### Stop Buy
* stop loss is for protecting downside, this one is a **stop market** works the same as a buy market on a limit buy. Dont want to put stop market in on low cap / low float, generally use a limit instead. Most of the time i use stop markets because if you put in a stop market and it skips over your price it doesn't get filled. 
* ![1](https://imgur.com/VemoePw.png)
* **stop limit** 
* ![1](https://imgur.com/EawZmAs.png) **Stop limit** that means that once it flips over to 289.50, as soon as it gets filled at 289.49 it will try and get to the best price possible. **If its small caps with big spreads, they sometimes wont get filled properly.** So keep in mind, keep eye on level 2 and how stock trades throughout the day so not missing a stock or getting stopped out way lower than you would like to and taking a bigger loss.

#### Trailing stop
* will follow your price upand try to sell on a drop, can use % or dollar amount, so what that means is if the stock is riding, its not going to sell you out until it drops .20 cents. At .20 cent drop will sell out position. Good option if you are out and about and dont have a chance to watch it, say you are out at work can throw on trailing stop for .5% or something if you up 2%, that way gurantee 1.5% profit. 
* ![1](https://imgur.com/1C5aGzL.png)

#### LOO Limit on open /  LOC Limit on close
* this is just for open say you want a stock at open will take any price up to 10 cents from where it opens, I dont use these much.

#### Durations
* `Day` This means by end of the day its going to cancel your order if it doesn't get filled
* `GTD` good until canceled, will stay open until you close the order
* `GTEM` good till extended market, e.g. after hours some brokers like webull offer after market trading hours and also premarket 
* `fok` fill or kill, if you dont get ENTIRE order filled at price you want cancels order and have to put it in again
* ![1](https://imgur.com/288Nx6J.png)

### How To Set Stop Losses

* Valuable tool for `predicting` how much money you will gain or lose on each trade.
* Stop loss comes to personal preference and types of trades, e.g. swing vs long. Going to want to make your decisions on longer charts like daily or 4h, and probably trading less capital vs a day trader who needs to put up a lot more money to make those 2-3% gains count, day traders usually use tighter stop losses vs swing traders.
* for arguments sake, should be entering trade for some reason, wether a brekaout from the base or oversold, `want to be calculating risk reward before hand`.

### How To Manage A Stock Market Portfolio With A Busy Schedule

* last week we went over why `ETF's` are better than mutual funds and how passive investing works all that kind of stuff, the banks get 2-3% commission on these mutual funds that they sell you, plus financial advisors charge $200-$500 to $1k an hour for a full laid out plan and help you through ti
* Its keeping it simple guys dont have time to look over shoulder constantly, and alot of those active funds dont end up outperforming mar,ket anyways. Best way is to $ cost average, adding certain amount w/e your comfortable with each week or month and can play around with compound calculator from that point on that we talked about a few weeks back
* in general people will do their age in bond % out of 100. So say im 30 years old ill have 30% of my portfolio in bonds and 70% in equities, and rebalance annually at end of year or w/e makes sense. Reason for this is, when equitiies do really good sell some of those and sell them to buy bonds, and when equities are doing really bad take money out and get bonds and come in at the bottom of the market. This is the s&p 500 the index doesn't work on trading view for some reason but it goes back to 1930, in general markets go up and to the right through time
* So when market crashed in 2008 if you had a percentage in bonds it held pretty well ![1](https://imgur.com/undefined.png)
* Thats reason we keep bonds in our portfolio , other thing is risk level / tolerance
* theres risk of dips in market, but also missing out on returns

#### ETF's

* Warren Buffet is a big fan of just buying S&P500 and nothing else, lots of S&P companies diversified with wide global reach.

## Swing Trading Setups and Mapping [Stock Market Basics]

* My definition of a swing trade is holding it anywhere from 1 to 2 weeks, could be longer, depending on how thesis and stops hold. For a long trade  looking to catch a bottom or  a back test, idea is to get a break out, have it back test and hold -  that’s how I typically do it
* A million ways to do a swing trade though, can do partial position on breakout, can scale profits out and sell 25% at profit target 1, 25% profit target 2, or all in all out, I lean more toward scaling in so that way I can lock in some profits or spreads and taking 50% of profits because lower risk don’t have to baby sit as much.
* heres an example of a backtest 
* ![1](https://imgur.com/du5k4us.png)
* ![1](https://imgur.com/tz5UHHL.png)
* on this chart would have entered around $255.04 
* ![1](https://imgur.com/kTkr7c7.png)
* Could have it even tighter if you were only willing to lose .50 to $1
* could have then just rode the 1h all the way up to 279.08 for about 9.5% increase
* ![1](https://imgur.com/9SzOIOK.png)
* Bottom play, I traded netflix and tesla bottoms, haven't been doing as many swing trades lately (video premiered march 4 2020) and have been trying to lock in profit and havne't been sure where market is going to top out, so I make my $100-$200 every trade and walk away and try to be happy with that.
* Netflix here had earnings miss, huge gap down. Could have rode this from 310.75 to 335 or so ![1](https://imgur.com/qKFPJlQ.png) this is an example of trying to catch the bottom. risk would be buying it bottom and its not actually the bottom, or minimal gains if it bounces off the next resistance level ![1](https://imgur.com/bdRimU2.png) ideally want to catch these sort of trend moves in a BULL MARKET
* S&P had another good example  ![1](https://imgur.com/iyiZRvL.png)
* ![1](https://imgur.com/NYBN04o.png)
* can look for patterns to such as `cup and handle`
* try to find 4-6 trades a week one or two a blue chip, one IPO (such as slack) which is higher risk but they move nicely like beyond me, crowd strike, sometimes for IPO's need hourly to find support resistance if not enough data 

### Disney Example using Psychological Levels for Profit Targets
Disney Example
* So first put down our `trendlines` ![1](https://imgur.com/AIB22mY), again try to get as many data points as we can
* ![1](https://imgur.com/Ip0iWsJ.png)
* next `support and resistance`, try to place them on either the bottoms or tops of the candles, can use `magnet` to help snap to these levels
* ![1](https://imgur.com/x8pmN9Z.png) not going to be perfect just trying to catch as many data points as you can
* for profit targets going to use `psychological levels` 140, 147, 149.5, 152
* going to make sure indicators not too overbought (I use `stochastic` alot but `rsi` is good too), been experiencing with `macd` lately. `macd` is a momentum indicator, look for trend changes here. See here heavy selling (dark red bars, then less selling light red bars) and its sort of making a trend line
* Using these tools to help make an informed guess on `trend change` ![1](https://imgur.com/hTnIKMw.png)
* onto the graph we are looking for a `break and back test` of 145, thats our first `buy trigger`
* ![1](https://imgur.com/hbFLzgp)
* second `buy trigger` would be a back test of the `trend line itself`
* ![1](https://imgur.com/bMYBrZ9.png)
* If I am buying with 145 as my target, tight stop would be here in orange, would want to wait for back test instead of putting stop in right away and could probably put your initial stop loss at the second support line - and once you clear the backtest move your stop up. Thats a pretty good strategy ratcheting your stop up and taking profits on the way out.
* ![1](https://imgur.com/I3pQWmW.png)
* he posts this chart to slack after

### Tiered Profits and Tiered Stop Losses
* dont want to put your stop losses RIGHT at resistance because good chance this can be backtested in most moves, instead a little lower to get some breathing room dont want to get `stopped out early` but agian depends on risk tolerance and position amount
* ![1](https://imgur.com/Khu1MqC.png)
* ![1](https://imgur.com/Pu3sLnw.png)
* ![1](https://imgur.com/G374QV7.png)
* ![1](https://imgur.com/UvZQcPr.png)
* This is what I go through pretty much every sunday 1 blue chip, 1 ipo, some small caps etc, scan twitter for a few people that i follow for watch list and look through those and see if i agree with them and try to pick the best ones that I see. Can't look at every stock in the world so you might have better ideas than I do.
* Can do `tiered profits and tiered stop losses`, stop 1 (tight 1), stop 2 (at a support level), stop 3 below a support level

### Blue Skys - Uncharted (literally) territory
* ![1](https://imgur.com/ifzCPPR.png) on this cup and handle, handle is a bit extended here.
* ON BLUE SKYS bollinger bands can serve as support/resistance lines because you are past the previous ATH, you are literally in uncharted territory and since bollinger bands are 1-3 std deviations away from current price they are great to serve as these support / resistance levels in blue sky situations. 
* `draw trendline`, this one is looking toppy so exercise caution, but still bullish
* using top of wicks for `resistance` levels and `support`.
* we're going to `blue skys` again so we got to try and pick our levels out.
* so again looking for a `break` above resistance or `back test of trendline` or both, if you catch a golden cross as its happening or before its happening or even a bit after usually have plenty of room to move, but in this example we aregetting very close to the upper extent of the bollinger bands, which can serve as resistance levels because these are 1 - 3 standard deviations above current price.
* ![1](https://imgur.com/hIgNkkQ.png)
* previously we had alot of room to move up before we hit the bollinger bands (yellow X), where as where we are right now (red x) bollinger bands are getting quite narrow and running out of room and tightening could cause us to breakdown
* ![1](https://imgur.com/quRs9C8.png)
* ![1](https://imgur.com/SSafFOh.png)


### Short setup use PUTTS not shorts
* Want to try to catch the shorts at the top, this setup is looking like a `inverse hammer`
* `I generally give putts with short setups because your risk is limited because can only as much as your putting in, but if your shorting a stock you can lose infinite amount of money potentially in theory. Like if you shorted beyond at 30 bucks and it goes to 300 yo got smoked if you had 100 shares and didn't cover thats alot of money thats why i like putts more than shorting stock itself.`
* ![1](https://imgur.com/tcSSO70.png)
* setting up putt profit targets, call some of these zones `air pockets` because not much support ![1](https://imgur.com/UzawrS2) a little support but not significant, yoru resistance / support levels with breaks helps identifiy these soft support areas very well. think of support made of hard robust concrete, vs support made of straw and twigs thats an air pocket, if velociy downwards is intense its going to cut through that support easily. For example low volume, death cross, overbought etc.
* so with putts everything is going to be the exact opposite, instead of stop losses being below our targets, its going to be above our targets. So its actually a `buy stop` instead of a stop loss in this scenario. For this one if i had moving cross average upward, or stochastic going upward id probably look for an exit, depends on risk and if you want to scale out on way up or down etc.
* with swing trading generally prefer options and smaller position sizes because never know whats going to happen over night.
