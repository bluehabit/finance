support broken = bullwick

resistance broken = bearwick


## Weekly/Monthly and Daily Trendline relationship

Can do macro to micro trend lines for example weekly to daily, daily to 45 min etc. to help identify important levels

## Put and Calls

A **put** is a bet that the stock price will go down, so you get the right to sell the security (stock) at a certain price and then a call is the opposite, you get the option to buy the contract at a certain price. These options have a date stamp on them which makes them more risky, because if you are wrong at a certain time your option price could go to zero. With a stock can hold onto it indefinitely if you want and it could go back up, but an option, if youâ€™re wrong in a certain span of time it goes to zero and you get nothing for it

## Cognitive Bias

## Confirmation

blaze capital said he had a video of combinging indicators like support levels, RSI, sma. Waiting for confirmation for entries and exits. What serves as confirmation, in a lot of videos backtesting a support line seems to serve as confirmation according to them. I think matt says he usually uses the death / golden cross to CONFIRM price direction

## NYSE 

The NYSE is open from Monday through Friday 9:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. Eastern time. That is 1 hour *ahead* of central time. 

## Candles

![1](https://imgur.com/2nPIzSh.png)

## macro to micro

* index such as S&P500 
* sector of S&P500, like QQQ financials
* big players within sector 
* individual stocks
* tech analysis (smas, RSI, candle patterns etc.)

SMA Legend
* 20 - very short term
* 50 - short term
* 100 - medium term
* 200 - long term

SMAs can serve as support/resistance lines as well.

Use mutliple tools together for confirmation

* momentum will continue unless proven otherwise
* magnets / aka gravity, trends go toward these magnets at support and resistance lines

* good old fashioned support/ resistance levels
* bollinger bands 2 / 3 std deviations & pierces
* bull/beark wicks
* SMA simple moving average death cross (lower moving average crosses OVER larging moving average), golden cross (larger moving average crosses over lower). Like when you look at IOTAs explosion you notice price action gets scooped up and rides the trend line where, the trend line reverses, and what once was crushing the stock, launches it.
*volume
* RSI/Stochastic 
* rawing trendlines

Not implemented yet
* fib/fibonacci levels Do they have a video on that?
* candle patterns
* overall patterns (wedge, funnel etc., head and shoulders, reverse head and shoulders, hammer)

Probably not going to use much:
* EMA exponential moving average (probably not going to use this one more for short trades)
* VWAP is intraday only, so must pick time frame less than 24h for it  to display correctly, 
volume weighted adjusted price
below orange line average person today who bought
losing money
if above average person who bought making money
going into close if average person is a loser more likely to sell than if they are making money

## Plan the Work, Work the Plan

next after projecting, need to set price targets, levels of support, what happens on break up, break down etc.
these are your PLANS. PLAN the work, work the plan

when does new volume candle post for cyptos? this its like 7pm / 630pm

good indicators for highly volatile/parabolic charts like cryptos?

get bollinger bands to display 3 std deviations instead of one giant green glob
