## Candles

## macro to micro

* index such as S&P500 
* sector of S&P500, like QQQ financials
* big players within sector 
* individual stocks
* tech analysis (smas, RSI, candle patterns etc.)

SMA Legend
* 20 - very short term
* 50 - short term
* 100 - medium term
* 200 - long term

SMAs can serve as support/resistance lines as well.

Use mutliple tools together for confirmation

* momentum will continue unless proven otherwise
* magnets / aka gravity, trends go toward these magnets at support and resistance lines

* good old fashioned support/ resistance levels
* bollinger bands 2 / 3 std deviations & pierces
* bull/beark wicks
* SMA simple moving average death cross (lower moving average crosses OVER larging moving average), golden cross (larger moving average crosses over lower). Like when you look at IOTAs explosion you notice price action gets scooped up and rides the trend line where, the trend line reverses, and what once was crushing the stock, launches it.
*volume
* RSI/Stochastic 
* rawing trendlines

Not implemented yet
* fib/fibonacci levels Do they have a video on that?
* candle patterns
* overall patterns (wedge, funnel etc., head and shoulders, reverse head and shoulders, hammer)

Probably not going to use much:
* EMA exponential moving average (probably not going to use this one more for short trades)
* VWAP is intraday only, so must pick time frame less than 24h for it  to display correctly

## Plan the Work, Work the Plan

next after projecting, need to set price targets, levels of support, what happens on break up, break down etc.
these are your PLANS. PLAN the work, work the plan

when does new volume candle post for cyptos? this its like 7pm / 630pm

good indicators for highly volatile/parabolic charts like cryptos?

get bollinger bands to display 3 std deviations instead of one giant green glob
