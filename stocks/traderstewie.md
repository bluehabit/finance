No one indicator is going to be successful on its own, it needs to be used with conjunction with other tools such as volume, market sentiment, etc. MacD is a momentum indicator with convergeance divergence

Personally when I use the MacD I am looking for divergences, there are two types of divergence, bullish and bearish. I love to track 15min, 30min, 1h to track it and find potential warning signs, either topping out or bottoming out. The reason I am saying small is because of the size of charts I am using 15/30/1h. Can create a short term trading opportunity, maybe a week or less using these time frames. 2, 3, 4 day trade would be the maximum I would recommend for the 15/30 min charts

This exact chart was emailed to my art of trading subscribers who pay a monthly fee of at least $120 a month. Can see this head and shoulders pattern with the purple arrow.
Whenever you see a big gap up, or gap down like this (both circled in red) - these are usually times to really pay attention. Cannot be complacent or ignore these. 

Why I was suspicoius here on the gap down and this rally that started to fail. In green we have a **gap fill**. We started to see these divergences. Can start to see a bearish divergence on the RSI and MacD

Lately (when he recorded this in may 2012) head and shoulders patterns haven't been very reliable, but when the MacD and RSI confirm its time to pay attention. Mutliple lines of evidence suggesting caution.
