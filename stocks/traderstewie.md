No one indicator is going to be successful on its own, it needs to be used with conjunction with other tools such as volume, market sentiment, etc. MacD is a momentum indicator with convergeance divergence

Personally when I use the MacD I am looking for divergences, there are two types of divergence, bullish and bearish. I love to track 15min, 30min, 1h to track it and find potential warning signs, either topping out or bottoming out. The reason I am saying small is because of the size of charts I am using 15/30/1h. Can create a short term trading opportunity, maybe a week or less using these time frames. 2, 3, 4 day trade would be the maximum I would recommend for the 15/30 min charts

This exact chart was emailed to my art of trading subscribers who pay a monthly fee of at least $120 a month. Can see this head and shoulders pattern with the purple arrow.
Whenever you see a big gap up, or gap down like this (both circled in red) - these are usually times to really pay attention. Cannot be complacent or ignore these. 

Why I was suspicoius here on the gap down and this rally that started to fail. In green we have a **gap fill**. We started to see these divergences. Can start to see a bearish divergence on the RSI and MacD

Lately (when he recorded this in may 2012) head and shoulders patterns haven't been very reliable, but when the MacD and RSI confirm its time to pay attention. Mutliple lines of evidence suggesting caution.

Then we start tanking, and then I see the exact opposite starting to occur. **Before we had a bearish divergence where we had the price making higher highs, but the momentum indicators putting in LOWER highs.** A downward slope. 

Now opposite, bullish divergence. RSI and Macd here are starting to a show a **higher low**, an upward slope. What that tells me even though S&P is tanking, the momentum indicators on the downside tell me that the downside momentum is not being confirmed by these indicators (macd/rsi) due to higher lows. So if you were to think yah the market is going to keep tanking, be watchful, you could buy puts (betting market will drop) but meanwhile if you dont know whats going on under the hood with these momentum indicators wouldn't know that a reversal is possibly happening with this upward slope / higher lows. 

Private members asked him during this time, he Stewie should we short here, my answer was no. No-way do not short here. When i start seeing bottom patterns like this, I start looking for long positions.

Same chart, but on 1D since I dont have data for 30min chart that far back

Telling us opportunity for a bounce here. Wait for confirmation however

But just imagine if we dont bounce, we can drop down another leg because that would be 3rd test, and imagine what market sentiment will be like at that point, very negative (shown in black cross below)

In this hypothetical situation, probably big snap back rally. 

Use RSI and MacD as momentum indicators, tell me wether momentum on downside is slowing down, or momentum on upside is slowing down. When momentum is slowing down on the upside looking at a pull back or topping out situation and vise versa when you see momentum on the downside start to slow down tell you sellers getting less aggressive and pointing to short term bottom or potential bounce
